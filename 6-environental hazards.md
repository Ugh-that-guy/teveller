Environmental Hazards
Not all threats carry weapons. Starfarers must contend with disease, radiation, and extreme environments when exploring distant stars. This chapter provides simple rules for implementing these hazards in your game.

Disease and Poison
When a character is exposed to a disease or poison, they must make an Endurance throw. The target is the pathogen’s Virulence number. If successful, the character shrugs off the effect. If the throw is failed, the disease damages the character’s Stamina according to the listed damage. The infected character must repeat this throw after the pathogen’s listed interval. Success means recovery and failure causes the listed damage, again. If this damage reduces the character’s Stamina to zero, additional damage applies to Lifeblood. The character cannot heal any damage until they recover from the illness or poisoning. Note that most poisons do not have an interval, but rather cause their damage immediately upon poisoning and only once.

Sample pathogens
Pathogen	Virulence (END throw)	Damage	Interval
Pneumonia	6+	1D	1D weeks
Anthrax	9+	1D	1D days
Biological Weapon	12+	3D	1D hours
Arsenic	8+	2D	-
Tranq Gas	10+	Unconscious	-

Extreme Temperatures
Extreme environments damage unprotected characters, as noted in the table below.

Temperature	Damage	Example
-100° or less	1D/round	Deep space
-50°	2D/hour	Mars
-25°	1D/hour	Arctic
-10° to 40°	None	Typical Terra
50°	1D/hour	Searing desert
100°	2D/hour	Boiling point
200° or more	1D/round	Mercury

Fire
When exposed to fire, characters must throw DEX 8+ to avoid catching fire. A burning character takes 1D damage per round. Make another DEX 8+ throw each subsequent round; if successful, the character puts out the fire. If failed, the character suffers another 2D damage. Putting out the fire by other means, such as an extinguisher, also stops this continuous damage. Note that space suits, encased armor, and powered armor render their wearers immune to fire damage.

Falling
A character suffers 1D damage per 2m fallen, up to 6D at terminal velocity. Multiply this damage by the world’s gravity rating in Gs. For example, falling 10 meters on a world with 0.45Gs would inflict 5D damage, which is then multiplied by 0.45 for the actual damage result – 2.5D rounded up to 3D.

Radiation
A character exposed to radiation accumulates rads. Unless treated with anti-radiation medication, this radiation exposure remains forever. Even after a character has recovered from radiation sickness (see below), accumulated radiation remains. Additional significant exposure will cause more severe sickness as any new exposure accumulates with all previous exposures before determining damage.

Radiation Exposure Levels
Source	Instant (rads)	Extended (rads)	Example
Constant, low	-	1D/hour	Cosmic radiation
Constant, moderate	-	1Dx10/hour	Nuclear fallout
Constant, severe	-	1Dx100/hour	Solar flare
Acute, low	3D	-	Far nuclear blast
Acute, moderate	1Dx10	-	Particle Weapon
Acute, severe	1Dx100	-	Near nuclear blast
Exposure to radiation might lead to radiation sickness, depending on the amount of rads the character has accumulated. Use the disease and poison rules, in conjunction with the table below.

Radiation Sickness.
Irradiation	Total rads	END Throw	Damage	Interval
Mild	99 or less	None	None	None
Low	100-199	5+	1D	1D weeks
Moderate	200-599	6+	1D	2D days
High	600-999	7+	2D	1D days
Severe	1,000-10,000	8+	3D	1D hours
Extreme	10,000 or more	12+	6D	1 hour

Starvation and Dehydration
A character requires two liters of water and 0.5kg of food per day to stay healthy. Special high-tech rations (TL8+) are a lightweight, though unappetizing substitute for food.
A character may go without water for 20 hours + twice their END score with no ill effect. After that time has passed, the character must throw END 6+ per hour without water or suffer 1D damage. There is a cumulative DM-1 with each additional check.
A character may go without food for 3 days. After that, the character must throw END 6+ per day without food or suffer 1D damage. There is a cumulative DM-1 with each additional check.
The character can recover this damage only after drinking and eating.

Suffocation
In cases of insufficient oxygen, such as on a ship with failing life support, characters suffer 1D damage per minute. If the character has no access to any oxygen whatsoever, like when a character is being strangled, or has been sucked out into space, the damage is 1D per round instead.

Vacuum Exposure
Contrary to popular belief, vacuum does not kill immediately. A character exposed to vacuum suffers regular suffocation damage (above). While exposed to space they also suffer 3Dx10 rads of radiation per round. Additionally, beginning from the third round of vacuum exposure, the character must throw END 10+ per round or fall unconscious from aeroembolisms – the formation of air bubbles in their blood stream.
