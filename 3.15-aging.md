Aging
Characters must make aging rolls beginning at the age of 34, or at the end of 4 terms, if rolling for term length. At the end of the 4th term, and on the end of each subsequent term, throw 2D on the following table. The characterâ€™s total number of terms serves as a negative DM to the throw. The Referee might add DM+2 for characters living in technologically advanced societies with good health care (see below).

2D	Effect of Aging
-6	Reduce three physical characteristics by 2, reduce one mental characteristic by 1
-5	Reduce three physical characteristics by 2.
-4	Reduce two physical characteristics by 2, reduce one physical characteristic by 1
-3	Reduce one physical characteristic by 2, reduce two physical characteristics by 1
-2	Reduce three physical characteristics by 1
-1	Reduce two physical characteristics by 1
0	Reduce one physical characteristic by 1
1+	No effect

Aging Crisis
If any characteristic falls to 0 due to aging, the character must throw 6+ to survive. If still alive, they will now have that characteristic at 1, and must retire from their career.
Optional Rule: Aging and Technology
Advanced medicine prolongs life and delays aging. At TL8-10, add DM+1 to all aging rolls during character generation. This DM increases to DM+2 at TL11-12, and to DM+3 at TL13+.
