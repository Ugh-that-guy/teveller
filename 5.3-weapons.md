Weapons
Interstellar adventurers face their adversaries with blades, bullets, and lasers. Here we present a few common and iconic weapons used by starfarers.

Stat Explanations
Tech Level (TL): technological level, as noted above.
Range: Effective/Maximum range in meters. To attack with a ranged weapon within effective range throw Gun Combat/DEX or Heavy Weapon/DEX 8+; beyond effective range, throw Gun Combat/DEX or Heavy Weapon/DEX 10+.
Damage: damage caused by the weapon, expressed as d6s.
Magazine: The amount of ammunition the weapon holds. If the magazine requires additional time to reload, this is noted.
Ammo Cost: per magazine, in Credits.
Cost: The weapon’s cost, in Credits.

Weapon Aspects
Weapons have Aspects describing any special characteristics, as noted on their table.
Auto X: These weapons fire multiple rounds with every pull of the trigger, filling the air with a hail of fire. A weapon with the Auto aspect can make attacks in three fire modes: single, burst, and full auto, as described in the Combat chapter.
X AV Hits: These weapons are useful for attacking armored vehicles.
Blast X: This weapon has an explosive component or is otherwise effective against all targets in its blast radius. The number given is the blast radius in meters. It is possible to avoid or minimize blast damage, see Diving for Cover in the Combat chapter.
Bulky: A Bulky weapon has powerful recoil or is simply extremely heavy. This makes it difficult to use effectively in combat by someone of a weak physical stature. Characters with STR 8 or less suffer DM-2 when using such weapons. Bipod and Tripod accessories (see below) remove the Bulky aspect, as long as the weapon is stationary and mounted on the bipod or tripod.
Double Tap: the weapon can be fired rapidly, but at a severe loss of accuracy. It may fire 2 bullets in one attack to gain DM+1 to damage.
Fire: On a successful hit, throw 6+ for the target to catch fire. A burning target takes 2D damage per combat round for 1D rounds, or until put out. See the Environmental Hazard Chapter for Fire effects.
Laser: At the Referee's discretion, atmospheric conditions, such as thick smoke, might incur a negative DM to laser fire.
Scattergun: Each attack fills the air with a hail of small projectiles, either flechettes or shot. Scatterguns cause 4D damage at Effective range or closer and attacks with scatterguns are made with DM+1. Anyone within 1.5m of the main target is also attacked by the scattergun effect, but at 2D damage. Beyond Effective range, scatterguns only inflict 2D damage and have no bonus to hit.
Stun: These weapons deal non-lethal damage and will incapacitate a living target instead of killing it. Damage is only deducted from Stamina, after considering any armor. If the target’s Stamina is reduced to 0, the target is incapacitated and unable to perform any actions for a number of rounds by which the damage exceeded his Stamina. Characters completely recover from Stun damage after one hour of rest.
Throwable: these weapons may be thrown; effective range equals to five times the thrower’s STR; maximum range equals STRx10.
Two-Handed: this melee weapon requires both hands to wield. However, all rifle-sized weapons must be wielded with two hands.
Zero-G: the weapon does not suffer a penalty for firing a weapon in zero-g conditions. Lasers automatically have the Zero-G Aspect.

Melee Weapons
The following weapons use the Melee Combat skill. Melee weapons cannot harm vehicles except in special cases, which are left to the Referee’s discretion.

Axe (TL0): a one-handed axe made from metal or stone, anything from a stone-age tool through a medieval war axe to a modern fire axe.
Broadsword (TL2): a large two-handed sword, counts as 2 “Items” for encumbrance purposes. A two-handed Great-Axe uses the same stats.
Cudgel (TL0): a large club or mace.
Cutlass (TL3): A short, broad slashing sword with a slightly curved blade and basket-guard hilt. Traditionally used by marines and pirates.
Dagger (TL0): a straight, short knife. When wielding a Dagger, a character may use both actions in a combat round to attack.
Machete (TL3): A simple yet sturdy broad blade used for cutting foliage and foes alike.
Neural Whip (TL13): Consists of a stocky handle connected to a flexible strap. Each stroke by this weapon causes stun damage as above. However, it has two additional vicious effects. First, any target hit by a neural whip must throw END 10+ or fall to the ground suffering from nightmarish pain and be incapacitated for 2D6 combat rounds. Second, in addition to the stun damage, the neural whip causes 1D physical damage per hit.
Shield (TL0): A personal shield, with which characters can bash enemies for 1D damage. Anyone carrying a shield penalizes enemies by DM-1 when they attack. If a shield is used with the Overwatch action in combat, the attack is penalized by DM-2.
Spear (TL0): from a sharpened shaft to a metal-tipped spear, this is a basic, yet effective, melee weapon.
Staff (TL0): A long wooden shaft, sometimes with metal fittings, used with two hands.
Stun Prod (TL8): A high-tech riot weapon augmenting the baton's blunt force with an electric charge capable of stunning opponents.
Sword (TL1): one of any variety of medium-sized one-handed swords, from gladius (shortsword) to longsword and rapier.
Vibroblade (TL12): An intermediate-sized bladed weapon using hypersonic micro-vibrations of the blade to create a potent cutting force.
A note on unarmed damage: any character can inflict at least 1 point of unarmed damage (before armor) even if their STR DM is 0 or lower.

Common Ranged Weapons
The following weapons use the Gun Combat skill. Unless otherwise noted, consider them as Small Arms against vehicle armor.

Assault Rifle (TL7): Standard military arm on mid-tech worlds. An automatic rifle that fires an intermediate caliber. At the Referee's discretion, its ammunition, or even magazines, may be interchangeable with those of a Carbine.
Autopistol (TL5): Semi-automatic handgun fed from a magazine.
Bows and Crossbows (TL0 and 2, respectively): muscle-powered ranged weapons. Ammunition for a Bow is held in a quiver of 20 arrows, which counts as one encumbrance item. A Bow may fire once a round; a Crossbow requires 2 actions to reload; a quiver holds 20 crossbow quarrels and counts as one encumbrance item.
Carbine (TL5): military longarm that uses a smaller caliber than a full-scale rifle. Carbines are lighter and shorter than rifles, and are often employed as survival weapons.
Gauss Pistol and Rifle (TL12): These weapons accelerate small metal spikes to supersonic velocities. Though the principles behind their function have been understood since the early industrial age, Gauss weapons are typically beyond the manufacturing capabilities of frontier worlds. They do appear, from time to time, in the hands of well-equipped mercenary forces.
Gyrojet (TL8): Designed for use in zero-G environment, the gyroget rifle fires self-propelled rocket rounds. It has minimal recoil and works perfectly in hard vacuum. The Gyrojet Pistol uses the same rounds as its larger cousin, but is used as a sidearm.
Light Machine Gun (TL7): Standard mid-tech squad-level support automatic weapon, typically belt-fed. Considered as two items for encumbrance purposes.
Pulse Rifle (TL9): An advanced rifle firing electrically ignited, caseless, high explosive, armor-piercing rounds. Provides a high rate of fire and a large magazine capacity.
Revolver (TL4): Simple semi-automatic pistol using a manually loaded rotating drum to feed the bullets. A reliable weapon.
Rifle (TL5): a standard military firearm on low-tech worlds that uses a large caliber projectile. At higher TLs, up to and including TL9, such weapons often serve as dedicated sniper rifles.
Shotgun (TL4): Scattergun firing a "shot" palette capable of hitting multiple targets at once. These particulate stats represent a pump-action weapon with an internal magazine.
Stealth Pistol (TL8): This is an especially light, discreet, and concealable weapon made from advanced polymers. A concealed body pistol can also be disguised as a number of more innocuous items, like comms, digital recorders, and so on.
Submachinegun (TL5): Light automatic weapon that fires pistol rounds. Submachinegun bullets are interchangeable with those of the autopistol; at the Referee's discretion, so are the magazines.
Tangler (TL12): A stubby, tube-like weapon using a gravitic launch system to deliver a capsule to its target. On a hit, the capsule erupts into a mass of adhesive tentacle-like strands, entangling the target creature and any other creature within a 5m radius. Any creature caught in the strands must roll STR 12+ to break out. The Tangler Gun creates enough strands to entangle a creature up to 500kg in weight; larger creatures are unaffected. On a failed roll, the target is immobilized and cannot act; they may attempt to free themselves each minute (10 combat rounds). Other characters can also cut entangled targets free using edged weapons. The Tangler comes with solvent capsules – which the weapon itself can launch as projectiles – which dissolve the tangling strands holding captives. Tangler strands hit with a solvent capsule will dissolve in one minute.

Blasters (TL13): are advanced laser weapons with a compact, internal battery, which is also removable and rechargeable.
Laser Pistol (TL10): Handgun-sized directed energy weapon attached to a belt-mounted power pack. The pistol and its power pack are considered one item together. The powerpack is rechargeable from any major power source, such as a ship’s powerplant.
Laser Rifle (TL9): Heavier version of the laser carbine, with better armor penetration, range, and even anti-vehicular capabilities. Requires a rechargeable heavy backpack power unit, which counts as a separate item. It is rechargeable from any major power source, such as a ship’s power plant.
Note that laser weapons suffer DM-1 to hit when used in environments with a great deal of particulates in the air, like sand, or ash. In these conditions, their ranges are reduced by half as well.
Plasma Rifle (TL16): The ultimate small arm, using miniaturized plasma gun technology to propel magnetically shaped pockets of super-hot plasma at its targets.
Stunner (TL10): Firing a precise electromagnetic pulse, this non-lethal weapon disrupts the target's neural processes, leading to stun and potentially unconsciousness.

Common Small Arm Accessories
The following accessories are commonly available for ranged weapons.
You may attach a Bayonet (TL2), identical to a dagger in its game statistics on its own, to any rifle-sized weapon. A rifle with a bayonet serves as a melee weapon equivalent to a Spear (3D damage).
Laser Sight (TL7): the bonus for Aimed Shots increases to DM+2, but only within Effective range. The DM+3 limit on aimed shot bonuses to hit is still in effect. Cr100.
Scope (TL6): the weapon avoids the penalty for firing beyond effective range, as long as the character used the Aimed Shot action before firing. Maximum range still applies. Cr200.
Silencer (TL6): May be attached to any firearm. Silencers work for single shots, and short bursts, but never Full Auto attacks.  Silencers provide a DM-4 to hear the gunshot sound. Cr250.
Smart Weapon (TL10): connects to a HUD or an implanted OmniComp. Grants DM+1 to all attacks. The Smart Weapon bonus is not cumulative with laser sights. This means that after one Combat Action aiming, the character can fire at DM+3. The DM+3 limit on aiming bonuses still applies. Cr1,000.
All Heavy weapons can be mounted on a Tripod (TL4), which negates their Bulky aspect. The weapon cannot be moved while mounted on a tripod. Tripods take 10 combat rounds (one minute) to set up. Cr100.

Common Heavy Weapons
The following weapons use the Heavy Weapons skill. All heavy weapons are considered 3 items each for encumbrance purposes. Ammunition belts, magazines, and individual rockets are each considered one item for encumbrance purposes.
Weapon	TL	Cost	Range	Dmg	Mag	Ammo

Disposable Anti-Vehicle Rocket (TL7): A cheap, one-use, portable rocket launcher. Functions as an armor-piercing rocket, with 2 AV hits against vehicles.
Flamethrower (TL6): Spews a stream of fire 3m wide at its far end. All targets within this cone suffer damage and catch fire. The tank for the flamethrower holds enough fuel for five full attacks and counts as two items for encumbrance.
Fusion Gun (TL14): The advanced development of the plasma gun. This weapon fires plasma bolts undergoing microfusion for massive damage. It uses a back-mounted micro-fusion reactor and thus, for game purposes, has unlimited ammunition. The ammo cost in this case represents purchasing such a backpack. Note that the backpack and gun constitute 4 items in total for encumbrance.
GP Machinegun (TL6): A “General Purpose" belt-fed medium machinegun. Often carried on vehicles as a heavy weapon but is also man portable.
Grav Launcher: Advanced micro-gravitic technology allows this weapon to guide a floating plasma bomb to its target without having to account for ballistic trajectories or inertia. Once launched, the bomb travels 50m per combat round. Its operator can move it in any direction and can also stop it and have it hover in mid-air. Detonation is on command. The bomb's internal battery allows for 10 rounds of gravitic flight.
Grenade Launcher (TL7): Grenade launchers fire grenades over long distances. Grenades for a grenade launcher are not interchangeable with handheld grenades.
Grenade Launcher, Under-Barrel (TL7): this weapon greatly increases the firepower of infantry. The under-barrel grenade launcher can be mounted under most two-handed firearms at TL7 or higher. It is not Bulky and can fire a single grenade before reloading. At TL10+, the weapon has a 3-shot magazine.
Guided Anti-Tank Missile (TL7): this is a portable guided missile system, like the AT-3 Sagger, or present-day Javelin or Eryx. These weapons must be fired from a fixed stationary position. However, the gunner need not be adjacent to the missile’s firing position.
Light Assault Gun (TL8): Heavy anti-vehicle rifle firing large armor-piercing shells.
Plasma Gun (TL12): High-energy anti-vehicular man-portable weapon firing magnetically contained plasma bolts. It requires a back-mounted, rechargeable power pack counting as two Items for encumbrance purposes.
Rocket Launcher (TL6): Man-portable rocket launcher utilizing unguided munitions. Rocket launchers are unsafe to use in enclosed spaces. Rocket payloads are considered high explosive and are not particularly effective against armored vehicles. Armor piercing rockets cost Cr500 per rocket: trade Blast 6 for 2 AV hits, Blast 1. An anti-aircraft homing missile (2 AV hits) costs Cr10000 and does not suffer a penalty when firing at fast-moving air vehicles.
Support Laser (TL8): Heavy directed-energy man-portable weapon for fire support and light anti-vehicular duties. Its back-mounted power pack counts as two Items for encumbrance purposes.

Grenades and Explosives
Throw Athletics/DEX 8+ to accurately throw a hand grenade within effective range, or Heavy Weapons/DEX 8+ to accurately launch a grenade from a launcher. The Effective range for thrown grenades is equal to five times the character’s STR. Maximum range for thrown grenades is STRx10.
On a failed grenade attack, thrown grenades will deviate 2D6 + (the margin of failure) meters from its intended target, double that for grenades fired from a launcher. Beyond Effective range a thrown grenade automatically deviates 2D6 – (Effect) meters, regardless of the result of the attack throw.
Throw Demolitions/EDU 8+ to properly set up an explosive charge for simple demolition, or Demolitions/EDU 10+ or greater for more complex jobs, such as setting a directional shaped charge explosive.

Smoke	6	Cr15	-	Blast 10 (smoke)

Dynamite (TL4): Low-tech explosive made of nitroglycerin, sorbents (such as powdered shells or clay) and stabilizers. Used for demolition but can also be thrown with a lit fuse as a "grenade".
EMP Grenade (TL8): Electro-Magnetic Pulse grenade emitting a powerful magnetic pulse capable of disrupting electronics but harmless to organic beings. It causes full damage to robots. Characters with implanted cybernetics are vulnerable to EMP but only take half stun damage (rounded up) from it. Non-cybered organic beings are immune to this stun damage. This grenade counts as a heavy weapon (2 AV hits) for the purposes of damaging TL7+ vehicles.
Flashbang Grenade (TL7): Non-lethal stun grenade emitting a powerful flash and deafening noise upon detonation.
Fragmentation Grenade (TL5): Basic anti-personnel hand grenade exploding into a hail of shrapnel.
HEAP Grenade (TL7): High Explosive Armor-Piercing anti-tank grenade using a focused blast to penetrate armor. This grenade can only be fired from a launcher and counts as a heavy weapon (1 AV hit) for purposes of damaging vehicles.
Molotov Cocktail (TL4): Home-made incendiary bomb commonly made from a glass container filled with highly flammable liquid and lit with a fuse.
Incendiary Grenade (TL6): Military-grade fire-bomb grenade.
Plasma Grenade (TL13): A plasma explosive device in a grenade-sized package. This grenade counts as a heavy weapon for damaging vehicles (2 AV hits).
Plastique (TL6): This generic, multi-purpose plastic explosive is a favorite of military units, terrorists, demolition teams and adventurers across known space.
Smoke Grenade (TL6):  Deploys a cloud of thick smoke upon impact. Apply DM-1 to all attacks passing through its Blast radius. They also apply a further DM-1 to laser weapons. The smoke stays in the air for 1D combat rounds.

Gunnery Weapons
The following weapons require a vehicular or fixed tripod mount. They use the Gunnery skill. Consider them as Gunnery Weapons when fired against vehicle armor.
AV Hits represents the number of rolls on the Surface Damage or Internal Damage tables if the weapon penetrates the target. If the weapon causes Critical Damage, roll only once on the Critical Damage table, regardless of how many AV Hits the weapon usually causes.
Direct hits on personnel with Gunnery Weapons are automatically lethal, unless the target is wearing TL13 powered armor, in which case, they take the Personal Damage listed here, normally. If the character is in the blast radius of a Gunnery Weapon, apply the Personal Damage normally, and see the rules on Diving for Cover in the Personal Combat chapter to maximize chances of survivability.

Air-to-Air Missile (TL7): this is a radar-guided or heat-seeking missile designed for use in air-to-air combat. TL8+ versions are self-guided suicide drones. These missiles can represent large surface-to-air missile installations as well.
Anti-Tank Missile System (TL7): A larger, vehicle or fixed-mount version of the guided missile heavy weapon, like the modern TOW or Hellfire missile. These missiles are very effective against slower armored vehicles.
Autocannon (TL 6): a rapid-fire cannon in the 20mm-30mm caliber range that is usually found mounted on aircraft and light vehicles. This weapon usually has enough ammunition for 10-20 short bursts.
Cannon, Light (TL5): a vehicle-mounted or towed gun in the 40-70mm caliber range, like the guns mounted on early Second World War tanks. They usually have between 40 and 100 shells in their magazine.
Cannon, Heavy (TL6): this large vehicle-mounted cannon is the main weapon of modern tank designs. This also represents field guns and light indirect artillery.
Cannon, Advanced (TL8): the final evolution of chemically-ignited direct fire heavy guns. Each projectile is an advanced charge that can be set to detonate in the air, upon contact, or designed to self-forge into an armor-piercing penetrator.
Fusion Gun (TL13): a large and bulky high-energy weapon that fires magnetically shaped bolts of plasma undergoing nuclear fusion. This weapon is powered by its own fusion reactor and thus has effectively unlimited ammunition.
Laser Cannon (TL8): the first battlefield energy weapon. This laser is more costly than an advanced cannon but has twice the effective range. Unfortunately for its operators, laser cannons suffer a DM-1 to hit when there is a large amount of particulates in the air.
Laser Cannon, Advanced (TL9): a fully developed, and thus cheaper, battlefield vehicle laser. It is still affected by particulates like all lasers.
Plasma Cannon (TL 11): The earliest high-energy weapon on the battlefield. The plasma cannon fires magnetically shaped plasma bolts that release enormous amounts of heat on the target. They are not long-ranged vehicle weapons.
Railgun (TL 10): an answer to newly developed laser cannon technology, the railgun fires a slug of nickel-alloy at hypersonic velocities. The weapon is cheap and has a very long range.
