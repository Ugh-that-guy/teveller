Equipment
This chapter describes some of the more common items found in an interstellar space opera setting. All prices are in Credits (Cr), the interstellar currency. Thousands of Credits are noted as KCr, and millions of Credits are noted as MCr. A Credit is a futuristic currency roughly equivalent to $3 USD in 2021CE currency.

Encumbrance
To facilitate fast play, TevellerRPG avoids the careful accounting of equipment by weight. Instead, a character may carry a number of major “items” equal to 7 plus their STR DM with no penalty.  This represents a Light Load. Characters may carry items beyond this, up to three times the base amount, which constitutes a Heavy Load. A heavily loaded character suffers DM-2 to all physical task throws and can only use a maximum of one move action in a combat round.
An “item” is anything of significant size: a gun, a medkit, a standard length of rope. Larger items may count as more than one item as noted in their description. Small items, such as a compass, a needle, or a candle, do not count as items, subject to the Referee’s judgment.

Tech Levels
TevellerRPG assumes an interstellar society – as befitting a space opera game. However, not all worlds in such a universe possess the same level of technological development, particularly in frontier or post-apocalyptic settings. Furthermore, Referees may want to choose between grittier, nearer-future interstellar sci-fi and no-holds-barred far-future galactic space-opera. For this purpose, TevellerRPG ranks civilizations according to 17 tech levels, from 0 to 16. We present some rough historical comparisons with our own world to assist Referees and players in their understanding of tech levels. However, these comparisons should not imply that your own game must follow the same technological development.

TL	Notable Characteristics	Historical Comparison
0	No technology, equivalent to the Stone age. Fire, agriculture, and stone tools.	Agricultural revolution, Stonehenge
1	Roughly on a par with Bronze or Iron age technology. Writing and mathematics.	Ancient Egypt, Classical Greece, Rome, and China.
2	Late Medieval technology. Simple black-powder firearms, ocean-going vessels	Renaissance Europe, early colonial America
3	Mass production allows for product standardization, heralding the beginnings of industrial revolution and steam power.	Great Britain circa 1770
4	The transition to industrialization is complete, bringing plastics, radio, and other such inventions.	Western Europe circa 1900
5	Widespread electrification, telecommunications, and internal combustion engines.	The First and Second World Wars
6	Development of fission power and more advanced computing.	Early Cold War
7	Can reach orbit reliably and has telecommunications satellites.	We are here
8	Possible to reach other worlds in the same system, although terraforming or full colonization is not within the culture’s capacity.	
9	Development of crude gravity manipulation and controlled nuclear fusion, which makes space travel vastly safer and faster; first steps into Jump Drive technology. The advent of a wide range of cybernetics.	
10	Development of gravitic vehicles revolutionizes transportation and warfare.	
11	The first primitive (non-creative) artificial intelligences become possible in the form of “low autonomous” interfaces, as computers begin to model synaptic networks.	
12	Weather control revolutionizes terraforming and agriculture.	
13	Powered Armor appears on the battlefield in response to new weapons. “High autonomous” interfaces allow computers to become self-actuating and self-teaching. Gravitics become capable of small-scale manipulation of matter.	
14	Fusion tools and weapons become man-portable.	
15	The development of longevity treatments means that the human lifespan is now vastly increased.	
16	Handheld plasma weapons and energy shields revolutionize warfare.	

Living Expenses
Characters not embarked on a starship must pay for lodging and food. The following table provides costs of living. One column shows a monthly cost of living – assuming long-term purchase of lodging and groceries. The second shows daily living, whenever characters or tourists pay for a motel or hotel room and buy prepared food. These costs include various expenses such as taxes and transportation. Characters should pay according to the quality-of-life representative of their SOC characteristic. Upper class characters living in squalor suffer penalties, as noted below.

Quality of Living	Monthly Cost	Daily Cost
Starvation (SOC 0-2)	Cr200	Cr8
Subsistence (SOC 3-5)	Cr500	Cr25
Ordinary (SOC 6-8)	Cr1,000	Cr50
High (SOC 9-B)	Cr5,000	Cr300
Elite (SOC C-F)	Cr15,000	Cr1,000
Starvation living means living in the streets, in a tent, or outdoors and eating just barely to keep the character alive. Clothes are basic and always second-hand or worn out. Healthcare, entertainment, and transportation are not included in this level. A character living at starvation levels is always Fatigued.
Subsistence living is the bare minimum for civilized life – a tiny apartment, shanty, or capsule in a "coffin hotel" and simple food and clothing. Subsistence level living includes public transit, minimal entertainment, and generally inadequate healthcare.
Ordinary living is how most people live in city centers: an apartment, public transit or a small personal vehicle, reasonable food and clothing, reasonable entertainment, and modern healthcare.
High living is the good life: a fancy apartment in the city or a small house, eating at restaurants for most meals, a good personal vehicle, partying on a regular basis, fashionable clothes, and good healthcare.
The Elite life means living like a king: a mansion or penthouse, regular feasts, or upscale restaurants, dressing in the finest clothes, and maintaining a prestigious personal vehicle. Healthcare is the best money can buy.
A character with SOC 10+ who does not live at a High or Elite level will suffer DM-2 to all high society related social skill rolls and may be ostracized by their high-class Contacts (at the Referee’s discretion).

Personal Armor
Personal armor reduces the damage caused by incoming attacks. Subtract the armor’s Protection rating from any damage caused to the character. It is not possible to wear more than one type of armor at a time, other than energy shields, which you may use together with any other armor.

Armor	Protection	Tech Level	Cost	Encumbrance	Skill Required

Leather jacket	2	1	Cr50	1	-
Heavy duster	3	6	Cr75	1	-
Bulletproof vest	4	7	Cr150	1	-

Armor Types:
Civilian and Paramilitary Protection consists of those armors that are either highly concealable, or that are acceptable to wear in most civilian settings. Characters wearing Utility Suits would never get a second look on the job where those suits are needed but wearing such a suit everywhere would raise eyebrows. Combat Armor is never discreet: whoever is wearing combat armor is signaling everyone around them that they are looking for trouble.
Bulletproof vest: lightweight ballistic armor torso protection, easy to wear under clothes.
Encased armor suit: heavy, full body rigid armor, often used by corporate SWAT and high-end mercenaries. The suit offers environmental protection as an Envirosuit (see below) and includes integrated comms and a HUD.
Energy Shield: a high-energy shield emitter worn on a belt clip, capable of stopping massive amounts of damage. The Energy Shield may be worn with other armor. An energy shield completely negates the first hit it receives in combat but is then depleted. Throw 1D every following combat round; on 4-6, the shield regenerates on your turn, and may negate another hit afterwards.
Envirosuit: a full body sealed suit with attached filters and an option to attach oxygen tanks as well. Fully protects against airborne toxins and pathogens. Reduces radiation by 20 rads. The Envirosuit counts as two Items for encumbrance purposes.
Envirosuit, Advanced: as an Envirosuit, but ultra-light. It does not count as an item for encumbrance purposes.
Heavy ballistic cloth: modern heavy-duty ballistic-cloth armor. Commonly worn by soldiers, well-equipped security, and TL7 mercenaries. Counts as two Items for encumbrance purposes and is not concealable.
Heavy duster: long overcoat made of reinforced leather or synth-leather. In some circles, this is the epitome of style.
Leather jacket: a heavy leather or synth-leather jacket.
Powered Armor: servo-assisted fully enclosed combat armor. This powerful armor Grants DM+2 to STR and DEX characteristic checks and allows carrying double the user’s Encumbrance. Powered armor grants DM+4 to all melee damage done by its wearer. Powered Armor protects against vacuum and hostile environments, as a space suit, with 6 hours of life support, and reduces radiation by 50 rads. Powered armor does not count as an item for encumbrance when worn.
Space Suit: a standard, futuristic space suit, lighter and cheaper than a 20th Century Terran space suit. A space suit carries life support supplies for up to 6 hours. It protects against Vacuum, Tainted, and Exotic atmospheres, as well as airborne pathogens. Offers 2D hours of protection against Corrosive atmospheres, and 1Dx10 minutes protection against Insidious atmospheres. Reduces radiation by 60 rads. Counts as 2 items for Encumbrance purposes.
Space Suit, Advanced: the final evolution of the space suit. An advanced space suit does not count as an item for encumbrance, is easy enough to use even without a Zero-G skill and provides life support for 12 hours. Offers the same environmental protection as a regular space suit.
Space Suit, Hostile Environment: a heavy-duty space suit designed for extreme conditions, such as Corrosive and Insidious atmospheres. Counts as three items for encumbrance. Protects against Vacuum, Tainted, Exotic, and Corrosive atmospheres, as well as airborne pathogens and toxins, and provides 2D hours of protection from Insidious atmospheres. Carries life support supplies for 6 hours. Reduces radiation by 150 rads. Counts as 4 items for Encumbrance purposes.
Synthsilk Armor: advanced bio-engineered spider-silk armor. Synthsilk is easily concealable and does not count as an item for Encumbrance.

Cybernetics
Cybernetic implants, a major theme in many science fiction tales, replace or upgrade body parts with biomechanical technology. Using advanced material science and cutting-edge knowledge of the neural system, cybernetics augment the organic body, adding capabilities beyond those given to it by evolution.

Cybernetic Grades and Points
Cybernetics in TevellerRPG come in four grades, detailed below. Each cybernetic implant cost Cybernetic Points. The implant’s Grade is the primary determiner of the number of Cybernetic Points it uses. Characters may have up to 6 Cybernetic Points’ worth of implants without penalty. Any more cybernetics, and the character will suffer from cyber-dissociation – being more machine than human. Cyber-dissociation applies a DM-2 penalty to all social skill throws (using SOC or any other characteristics). The only exception is when the character intends to intimidate others. In that case, there is no penalty.

Cybernetic Grades and Points
Grade	Cybernetic Point Cost	Typical cost	Description
A	0	Up to Cr1,000	Common implants used by civilians and typical corporate employees. Many of these can be implanted in out-patient procedures, depending on the world’s tech level.
B	1	Up to Cr10,000	Prosthetics and more specialized personal implants. Includes street-level combat implants that may or may not comply with the Law Level of a given world.
C	2	Up to Cr100,000	Highly specialized implants, rare among civilian populations, including military-grade combat implants, and other sophisticated cybernetics.
R	3	Over Cr100,000	The most advanced and invasive implants: the expertise alone required to install these cybernetics makes them exceedingly rare. The expense only compounds their rarity.

A-Grade Cybernetics:
These implants are either superficial, or extremely common among the public on most advanced worlds as to be ubiquitous.
Cyberfinger (TL9; Cr500): cybernetic finger replacement.
Glow Tattoos (TL9; Cr100): these are advanced tattoos consisting of smart bioluminescent skin grafts in complex patterns across the subject’s skin. Patterns and designs are up to the subject. The subject may activate or deactivate the tattoos at will.
Internal OmniComm (TL9; Cr100): as an OmniComm (see below) but with a neural interface; this implant allows tele-video communication in the user’s mind, without audible speech.
Internal OmniComp (TL9; Cr300): as an OmniComp (see below) but with a neural interface. The user can use their minds to operate the OmniComp without any gestures or speech. The details and consequences of having a computer implanted in a character’s brain and connecting to planetary computing grid are left to the players and Referee.
Internal Storage Pouch (TL9; Cr800): abdominal pouch accessible via an artificial sphincter. Stows items up to 0.5 kg in weight and 0.5 liters in volume. The Storage Pouch is discreet and can only be discovered by detailed inspection or medical scans.

B-Grade Cybernetics:
These cybernetic implants include most prosthetics to replace limbs or organs lost to injury, or more advanced and invasive devices that greatly expand human capabilities. Cybernetic prosthetics do not enhance the character’s innate characteristics—they only perfectly replace damaged parts. Some of these cybernetics are regulated by local Law Levels, while others are not.
Artificial Gill (TL9; Cr2,500): allows breathing underwater. The artificial gill is powered by the body’s own electrical current, and thus requires minimal maintenance. The gills can be hidden by default, though some may want them to be visible.
Cybernetic Eye (TL9; Cr5,000): a baseline cybernetic eye replacement, providing perfect 20/20 vision. This cyber-eye looks indistinguishable from a normal eye. However, many opt to add cosmetic changes to the eye, or even exposed chrome to the eye housing.
Cybernetic Eye, Advanced (TL11; Cr7,500): this implant operates as the baseline cybernetic eye, but also adds telescopic vision, infra-red imaging, and low-light optics.
Cybernetic Arm (TL9; Cr6,000): baseline cybernetic arm replacement. The arm can be customized to look however the character likes. Human-looking cybernetic arms can pass visual inspections but are detected by medical or detailed physical inspections.
Cyberhand (TL9; Cr1,500): cybernetic hand replacement. The hand can look however the character likes.
Cyberleg (TL9; Cr9,000): baseline cybernetic leg replacement. Cybernetic legs are large enough to install an Internal Storage Pouch at regular prices.
Data Safe (TL9 Cr5,000): this small implant stores encrypted files in the character’s skull. The data safe cannot be detected by normal sensors; a deep medical scan of the character’s brain is required to detect the safe. The character may or may not have access to the data safe, or the decryption key. On worlds with Law Levels 6+, the Data Safe is a regulated cybernetic.
Head Bomb (TL9; Cr3,,000): a tiny remote-controlled explosive device implanted in a subject’s brain. The detonation will kill the subject without causing any collateral damage. Head bombs are rarely implanted voluntarily, and are widely illegal.
Internal Blade (TL9; Cr5,000): a set of two 10cm (4”) retractable blades are implanted in the character’s limbs. These can be wrist blades, knuckle spikes, knee spikes, or even dew claws. The character’s unarmed attacks do 2D damage. The blades are constructed out of ceramic composites to avoid detection by most security scans. Only medical scans or TL13 or better sensors will detect the blades. Internal blades are considered illegal on world with Law Level 4+.
Internal Weapon (TL9; Cr5,000, special): this arm-mounted implant allows the character to carry a concealed weapon internally. This can be any pistol-sized weapon limited by tech level: stealth pistol, gyrojet pistol, gauss pistol, laser pistol, blaster pistol, or stunner. The weapon’s magazine capacity is half normal but can be reloaded normally via a retractable magazine holder. Internal weapons still suffer the DM-2 penalty to hit while in melee combat. The internal weapon’s price is Cr5,000, plus twice the weapon’s cost. Internal weapons can be detected with medical scans or detailed physical inspections. Internal weapons are considered illegal on worlds with Law Level 4+.
Internal Filtration System (TL9; Cr3,000): protects from airborne toxins and pathogens.
Internal Oxygen Supply (TL9; Cr4,000): provides 3 hours of oxygen.
Prehensile tail (TL9; Cr9,000): Provides an additional grasping/manipulating appendage. This appendage provides a DM+1 to any opposed grapple checks in melee combat but does not provide any additional actions. The tail is also strong enough to support the weight of its owner.

C-Grade Cybernetics:
These implants are all very invasive, and require the amputation of two limbs, and a great deal of surgery. They are thus almost always restricted and very expensive. C-grade implants are usually reserved for elite military and espionage operatives. Only the most well-connected and wealthy civilians can acquire them.
Advanced Cyberarms (TL9; Cr20,000): This implant replaces both arms, as well as reinforces the spine. Advanced cyberarms give Advantage to all arm/manipulation Athletics throws and DM+4 to unarmed combat damage. Note that this bonus applies to relevant Athletics tests, but not other skill tests. The damage bonus is cumulative with any internal blade damage bonus, and with the powered armor bonus. Advanced cyberarms count as two implants (total 4 cybernetics points), as they replace both arms.
Advanced Cyberlegs (TL9; Cr50,000): this implant replaces both legs and reinforces the hips and spine. Advanced cyberlegs give Advantage to all Athletics checks involving running or leaping, subject to the same limitations as Advanced cyberarms, above. As an action, the character may throw Athletics 8+ to jump 10m horizontally in any direction or 3m upwards. Treat the character’s STR as 4 points higher for purposes of calculating encumbrance limits. This implant also doubles the character's movement speed to 20m per action (up to 40m per round if the character uses both actions for movement). Advanced cyberlegs also reduce falling damage by 1D. Advanced cyberlegs count as two implants (total 4 cybernetics points), as they replace both legs.
Augmented Joints (TL9; Cr25,000): an invasive series of implants replace the character's joints with advanced synthetics, high-tech lubricants and shock absorbers. Augmented joints grant inhumanly fine motor precision. This gives Advantage for non-combat throws that require fine motor manipulation and control. For example: lockpicking, sleight-of-hand, and electronics repair.
Hacking Module (TL9; Cr50,000): this implant consists of an upgraded, specialized OmniComp and dedicated enhanced synaptic neural processors for computing. A discreet neural jack line feed allows the character to connect to any computer directly. The Hacking Module grants a flat DM+1 to the character’s Computer skill and allows remote hacking of unprotected electronics at up to 3m. Note that at TL9+, most personal electronics cannot be remotely hacked. The Hacking module is illegal on worlds with Law Levels 4+.
Hypercosmetic Surgery (TL9; Cr75,000): perfect body sculpting and implanted synthetic pheromone glands radically reconstructs the subject’s body to be perfectly attractive to other members of their species. Grants Advantage to all social skill throws in situations where physical attractiveness matters.
Subdermal Armor (TL9; Cr15,000): keratin and ceramic bone lacing and light shielding of vital organs provides 2 points of armor protection. The implant is subtle enough to pass visual inspection but can be spotted with sensor scans. Subdermal armor is added to the protection rating of any worn armor. Subdermal armor is legal on most worlds, but usually will be controlled on worlds with Law Level 8+.
Subdermal Armor, Heavy (TL9; Cr20,000): unlike the lighter variety, heavy subdermal armor makes no attempt at being discreet. It provides 5 points of armor protection that is added to the protection rating of any worn armor. Heavy subdermal armor is detectable upon visual inspection and counts as two implants (4 Cybernetic Points). Heavy subdermal armor is illegal on worlds with Law Level 3+.

R-Grade Cybernetics:
Extremely invasive, experimental, and irreversible cybernetics. These implants are all highly illegal for anyone to own, outside of restricted military circles.
Berserker Module (TL9; Cr200,000): this dangerous combat augmentation keeps the user going no matter what injury they sustain. The character stays conscious and active as long as they have even one point of Lifeblood left – even when severely injured. They still die if their Lifeblood reaches zero.
Bastet Frame Upgrade (TL9; MCr1): a radical reconstruction of the entire organic body to grant superhuman agility and speed. The implant doubles the character’s DEX (to a maximum of 20), and grants Advantage on all DEX-related Athletics and Stealth throws. Furthermore, the Bastet Frame increases the character’s movement speed from 10m per round to 15m per round. The Bastet Frame Upgrade is incompatible with the Hercules Frame Upgrade.
Control Rig Implant (TL9; MCr1): this is a highly specialized implant designed to give elite vehicle pilots even more of an edge. The control rig allows the operator to fully interface their minds with vehicles. The control rig gives the character Advantage on Vehicle skill throws with suitably modified vehicles. This does require the operator to be in the vehicle, and “plugged in.” Modyfing a vehicle to work with control rig increases its cost by 10%. If the vehicle takes damage, roll END 6+ to avoid taking 1D damage from electrical feedback.
Hercules Frame Replacement (TL9; MCr1): a radical reconstruction of the entire organic body grants superhuman endurance and might. The Hercules Frame doubles the character’s STR and END (to a maximum of 20), affecting Stamina, Lifeblood, and unarmed combat damage. It also gives Advantage on all Athletics throws requiring brute strength, and Grapple checks in Melee Combat. The Hercules frame upgrade is incompatible with the Bastet Frame Upgrade.
Military-grade Neural Cyberspace Interface (TL9; MCr1): the ultimate interface between the human brain and a machine. The neural cyberspace interface functions as a Hacking Module, but also grants Advantage to all Computer and Repair throws related to electronics and computers.
Minerva Upgrade (TL13 MCr3): this implant requires the radical reconstruction of the entire organic neural system. It includes synaptic enhancers, nano-tech upgrades to dendrites, and multiple supplemental neural processor implants directly in the brain. The end result is superhuman intelligence, doubling the character’s INT (to a maximum of 20).
Neural Booster (TL9; MCr2): this invasive augmentation to the character’s nervous system and adrenal glands greatly boosts reaction times and suppresses the fight-or-flight response. The Booster grants an additional action per combat round for a total of three. Characters with the Neural booster implant also roll to avoid Surprise with Advantage. As well, the character never suffers the unskilled penalty (DM-3) when rolling to avoid Surprise.
Vacuum Adaptation (TL13; MCr1): the ultimate spacer implant turns the user into a voidwalker. Internal oxygen reserves, micro-seals, and metal weave skin allow an hour of operation in vacuum without a space suit. An integral grav unit allows short-range maneuvering in low and micro-gravity. The grav unit is too weak to maneuver in any gravity beyond 0.05g. This augment also provides 5 points of integral armor and reduces radiation by 10 rads. The Vacuum Adaptation implant is visible upon medical inspection or sensor scan, but is otherwise quite discreet.

The Advanced Base is pressurized, modular, and capable of housing 6 persons. It requires 12 person-hours to assemble. Life support lasts for 24 hours without portable generator to power atmoscrubbers.
An Artificial Gill allows unlimited underwater activity on worlds with atmospheres 4-9.
An Awareness Disruption Field Generator (AwFiG) emits a low-grade psionic wave that affects the perception of those around, causing them to disregard or overlook the presence of a person or thing. To the passer-by the wearer of the AwFiG is not present or is just part of the background and is unlikely to be remembered.
A Backpack does not count as an item for encumbrance when worn. The items in the backpack still do count towards encumbrance.
A (Personal) Cloaking Device permits its user to become practically invisible. The light-distorting gravitic lensing of the device affects all visible light for organic and mechanical eyes. However, the target still emits infrared heat radiation.
Cold Weather Clothing protects against inclement weather. The TL12 version costs Cr800 and does not count as an item for encumbrance.
A standard set of lockpicks in a handy carrying pouch. Attempting to pick a lock without lockpicks penalizes the attempt by DM-2.
A Contra-Grav Cart is too slow to use as a vehicle but can carry up to 500kg of gear at a speed of 10m per combat action. With some versions, it is possible to “tether” the cart to a person, which makes the cart follow that specific person at a distance of 3m to 20m.
Corrosive Gel comes in small metallic tubes. It can be used to mark surfaces or to destroy small objects (like door locks).  The gel consists of a binary chemical agent in two chambers in the tube. Once opened and applied, the agents combine within 1D minutes. The exact effect is left to the Referee.  Each tube is one-use only.
An Exoskeleton grants its user a +6 bonus to their STR score for Athletics/STR skill checks. It also allows the character to jump up to 2m vertically, or 5m horizontally, and increases the wearer’s movement speed to 15m/action. Another benefit is that the exoskeleton allows soldiers to march their normal cross-country speed while tiring at half the rate. The exokeleton’s batteries are good for 48 hours of activity before requiring replacement. At higher tech levels, exoskeletons are often replaced by cybernetics.
5-days' worth of Field Rations each count as a single item for encumbrance. TL9+ field rations are much lighter: 25 field rations count as one item.
Firestarters are fast-burning chemicals in one-use packages. They will automatically start a sustainable fire with prepared wood and brush kindling. Throw Survive/INT 6+ to start the fire if the wood or other fuel is wet.
A Grav Lamp is a floating hands-free light source. It can illuminate an area between 2m and 10m in radius. The illumination radius is adjustable by means of a small lightweight “anchor” worn on the person and does not count as an item for encumbrance. The grav lamp will float near or next to the anchor, between 0.5m and 10m away, depending on the setting used.
A Hammock is a cloth or synthetic textile temporary sleeping surface, suspended between two fixed points. It can also be used as a shade. Supports up to 150 kg.
The Hooligan Tool is a 0.8-meter, 4 kg tool is designed to breach common door/hatch types. There is forked spade end (for getting doors open), a horn (for getting that initial grab into opening an iris valve or busting padlocks), and a wedge (for those pesky hatches). The tool is designed to maximize leverage. Made of special alloys and composites, the tool is non-sparking, a feature that prevents accidents in explosive atmospheres such as a ship with a liquid hydrogen leak. Complete with fiberglass shaft and hand grips made from non-conducting material.
An LED Flashlight is a hand-held, rubberized, sturdy light source with a variable light aperture. The 2m cone of light has a range of 50m, but it can be adjusted to illuminate a 5m radius. Smaller, more expensive (Cr20) versions can be mounted on weapons or clipped to armor. A TL7 LED Flashlight’s battery will last for 24 hours. By TL11, the battery will last for a decade of continual use.
A Mapper (Instant) can be attached to any hand computer or used alone. It consists of a computer, display, and launcher for a data-gathering probe. The probe is an anti-grav unit that will rise 100-200 m into the air and take 360-degree image of all visible terrain. This data is then compiled into a 2D, or 3D map displayed by the base unit. The Mapper also instantly calculates topographic features and distances to user-selected points.
A Measuring Tape (Advanced) consists of a base unit and one or more movable beacon units. When activated, the device displays the exact distance between itself and the beacons. It can be thus measuring the dimensions of any object, by placing the base at one edge and the beacon at the other, or placing two beacons on either side, or measure area by placing beacons on 4 sides.
Measuring Beacon: A larger-size version of the Advanced Measuring Tape, which can be used as a homing beacon. By leaving the base at a predetermined point and carrying the beacon, the user will always know which direction and how far to go to return to the base unit. The Measuring Beacon has a 500km range.
A Memory Randomizer is an insidious disguise device: everyone who comes into contact with the wearer of the Randomizer perceives the wearer but cannot accurately describe them. This makes them impossible to identify by memory unless the target makes a successful INT 12+ throw. The Memory Randomizer can be placed on an object to make it so ubiquitous as to be unrecognizable.
A Mess Kit (Individual) includes plate, utensils, cup, storage case and disposable cleaning cloths and counts as one item.
The Multiscanner combines several sensor functions: it can detect radiation, electromagnetic emissions, metals, and a limited set of chemicals and biological compounds. It can also perform standard blood tests.
The Night Visor combines low-light and infra-red vision goggles into one handy device.
Today’s smartphones will eventually evolve into an OmniComm, a combination of all your telecom needs in one device, with holographic augmented reality capability. The same applies the OmniComp – a hand-held, light-weight computer which evolved from both the laptop and the tablet computer.  Both devices are designed to integrate with whatever telecommunications networks are present on a given world. TL8 batteries for these devices last for a few days; TL9 batteries last for months between recharging.
The Omnitool is an auto-adjusting, auto-fitting repair tool. It will fit exactly to any kind of bolt, screw or fastening device, and also doubles as wire-cutters, small hack saw, flashlight, and a myriad of other tools. All this is packed into one item’s worth of encumbrance!
A Panic Button uses ultrasonic waves and other sensory inputs to produce a physiological and emotional terror response. The Panic Button influences the emotional states of creatures within a 5m wide, 15m long cone, forcing them to make Morale rolls.
A Pressure Tent lacks an airlock and must be depressurized to enter or leave; it can house up to 2 people and requires an external oxygen tank.
The Pulverizer is – a combination of hammer, nail puller and pry bar. Made of high-tech materials to be lightweight but highly durable. The Pulverizer adds DM+1 to any Strength roll to force open a mechanical object such as a door or iris valve.
The Radar Mapper uses radar technology to scan a room or similar space, producing a 3D map of it, to a maximum volume of 10m by 10m by 10m.
The Radiation Detector is a matchbox sized device that displays radiation levels in a 10m radius. It also indicates the type of radiation if that is important.  The detector can also serve as an alarm, chiming loudly when radiation levels are dangerous to humans. This feature can be shut off.
A Rescue Bubble is a 2m-diameter plastic bubble. Piezoelectric layers translate the user’s movement to electricity to recharge the bubble’s battery. It contains enough life support supplies for 2 person-hours of operation. The bubble’s skin can self-repair all but the most serious punctures.
A Sleeping Bag is a cloth or synthetic padded bag for one person, to provide insulation/ cover while sleeping. At TL 7, cold weather bags are available. Regular bags are effective to zero degrees centigrade, while cold weather bags, costing Cr150, are insulate to negative 30 degrees centigrade.
A Sonar Window is flat-screen device that attaches to a wall/partition.  It uses sonar to display what is on the other side of the wall. Image quality depends on Tech Level. The TL11 version displays basic outlines, the TL 12 version costs Cr2,000 and improves image quality and 3D effect. At Cr7,000, the TL14 version’s display is virtually indistinguishable from that of an actual window.
The Spray Sealant can seal torn space suits and small hull breaches. The canister is good for three such applications, or one larger hull breach.
The Super Adhesive is instant bonding and possesses super-strength. The adhesive comes in roughly 1L canisters that are sufficient for five generous applications. The adhesive adheres to most surfaces, has a drying time 1 minute. Pulling apart the two bonded objects requires a STR 12+ test and will ruin both objects. A special chemical is available for removing people glued to objects with Super Adhesive. It costs Cr100 per application.
The Super Lubricant is composed of near-frictionless space-age synthetics. Each can is good for six applications. The lubricant is a standard part of a maintenance tech’s toolset. In addition to loosening stuck objects and ensuring that the internal workings of any mechanical device are working properly, the Super Lubricant can render any surface near-frictionless. Standing on a surface coated in Super Lubricant requires an Athletics/DEX 10+ throw. Walking or, heaven forbid, running on such a surface is impossible. Crawling can be done at 1m per round.
A Thruster Pack requires Zero-G skill level 0 and allows maneuvering in zero-G conditions at normal movement rates. Note that this is a TL8 device and does not use any anti-gravity technology. Characters and objects moving by thruster pack are still subject to the laws of motion.
Water Purification Tablets cost Cr10 for a pack of 50; each tablet can sterilize up to 1L of water from most types of microorganisms.
A Water Saw requires a separate power supply and a large volume of available water. Pumps create extreme water pressure (90,000 psi or more) which is directed through a tiny nozzle. The stream is powerful enough to cut through concrete, stone, and even light metals. Weighs 1000kg and is usually mounted on an exoskeleton or small vehicle.
The handheld Welder uses a focused laser beam to perform cutting and welding operations. It can cut through a reinforced bulkhead in 1D starship combat rounds (6-36 minutes). Roll Repair/DEX 10+ to reduce the time to one starship combat round (6 minutes) As a weapon, the laser welder is inaccurate and clumsy, but extremely dangerous: it does 4D damage with a range of 1/5 and has energy for 5 “shots.” As a weapon, the welder also has the Fire aspect.

Pharmaceuticals
Below is a brief list of pharmaceuticals and drugs that are available at various tech levels.
Anti-Radiation
Administered before or immediately after radiation exposure, this drug absorbs 100 rads. Taking more than one dose a day causes 1D permanent END damage.
Cost: Cr1,000/dose
Tech Level: TL8

Catsight
This medication grants its user night vision for up to 12 hours. The character does not suffer penalties from operating and fighting in low-light conditions and only suffers DM-1 in total darkness.
Cost: Cr100/dose
Tech Level: TL9

Fast Forward
This drug slows metabolism by a ratio of 60 to 1 – a subjective day to the user is 2 months of real time. Note that this drug will greatly reduce life-support consumption and is often included in emergency survival kits aboard starships.
Cost: Cr200/dose
Tech Level: TL11

Slow Motion
This drug accelerates metabolism by a ratio of 1 to 60 – a subjective hour to the user is 60 hours of real time. Note that this drug accelerates healing accordingly. Using this drug is dangerous without Medicine 1 or better care.
Cost: Cr300/dose
Tech Level: TL11


Hyperspace
Hyperspace is a powerful stimulant, allowing characters to function perfectly for up to 72 hours straight without rest. Once its influence expires, the character is Fatigued (DM-2 to throws), loses 1D Stamina, and must rest for at least 12 hours to recover.
Cost: Cr50/dose
Tech Level: TL9

Longevity Treatment
Longevity drugs prevent aging. For them to be effective, a character must take one dose each month. If the character misses even one month of Longevity Treatment, they revert to their chronological age within a week, which may be lethal in some cases.
Cost: Cr5,000/dose
Tech Level: TL15

Panacea
The Medicinal drug represents a wide variety of vaccines, antitoxins, antibiotics, and other pharmaceuticals. Medicinal allows a character with at least Medicine 1 to neutralize a disease or poison on a throw of Medicine/EDU 8+. The cost of any drug is at the Referee’s discretion. Advanced TL11+ medications cost ten times as much but grant Advantage on the Medicine throw.
Cost: Cr50+/dose
Tech Level: TL5
