Starship Operations
The stars await! Adventurers ply the star-lanes and boldly venture into the unknown; others may serve in a navy, hunting pirates, or raiding enemy shipping. Still others may mine asteroid belts for valuable ores, smuggle goods to distant planets, or even engage in piracy. This chapter covers interplanetary and interstellar travel, as well as starship operations and procedures.

Interplanetary Travel
Starships and other spacecraft in TevellerRPG have reactionless real-space thrusters with an acceleration rating from 1G to 6Gs. Ships normally travel under full acceleration halfway to their destination, then decelerate for the other half of the journey. The following table presents abstracted in-system travel times according to the ship’s acceleration.

Common interplanetary travel times by acceleration
Destination	1-G	2-G	3-G	4-G	5-G	6G
Planetoid Jump Point	10m	7m	6m	5m	5m	4m
Ground to Planetary Orbit	33m	23m	19m	16m	14m	13m
Ground to Typical Planetary Jump Point	5h, 30m	4h	3h	3h	2h, 30m	2h
Small Gas Giant to Jump Point	12h	8h	7h	6h	5h, 30m	5h
Large Gas Giant to Jump Point	17h	12h	10h	9h	8h	7h
Planet to Close Neighbor	1d, 13h	1d, 2h	22h	19h	17h	15h
Planet to Far Neighbor	3d, 17h	2d, 15h	2d, 3h	1d, 20h	1d, 16h	1d, 12h
Mainworld to Close Gas Giant	5d, 16h	4d	3d, 7h	2d, 20h	2d, 13h	2d, 8h
Mainworld to Far Gas Giant	6d, 23h	4d, 22h	4d	3d, 11h	3d, 3h	2d, 20h
Travel times are abstracted and, as noted above, generally assume constant acceleration up to the halfway point and then constant deceleration down to the destination. Ships intending to jump will not decelerate towards the jump point. They will emerge from a jump at the speed they entered it.

Interstellar Travel
Interstellar travel in TevellerRPG uses a faster-than-light engine called the Jump Drive. Jump Drives are rated according to the maximum range in parsecs (represented on the star map as hexagons) they may travel in a single jump. Jump-1 drives can propel a vessel to an adjacent hex, while Jump-3 drives will move a ship up to three hexes. A single voyage through jump-space takes 1 week regardless of the distance traveled. Jump drives require a significant gravity well, like a star system, at both ends of the jump, but not too much gravity. It is impossible to purposefully jump to a destination without a star system. Jump drives are safe to use only at a certain distance from a planetary or stellar body. This is called the Jump Point or Jump Distance. A jump requires an amount of liquid hydrogen fuel equal to 10% of the ship’s volume per parsec traveled. For example, a 200-ton ship making a 3-parsec jump would burn 60 tons of fuel.
The jump drive propels the ship into a parallel dimension, called Jump Space. The jump fuel serves to envelope the ship with a hydrogen bubble, at a distance of approximately 5m in every direction from the hull – the so-called "Jump Bubble" – to protect it from the alien nature of Jump Space. Characters can safely go on EVA within the bubble but will be lost if they leave it and enter real, unprotected Jump Space – even if still tethered to the ship.

Interstellar Jump Procedure
1.	Calculate Plot: A jump requires a course calculation called a “jump plot”. Starports rated D or better sell up-to-date jump plots to nearby populated worlds for Cr1,000 per parsec. A skilled pilot can also calculate their own jump plot. Throw Piloting/EDU 6+ to calculate a jump plot, apply a negative DM equal to the number of parsecs the jump will travel; this takes 1Dx6 minutes (i.e., 1D ship combat turns). It is possible to rush this calculation, to guarantee that it will only take one ship combat turn, but the throw is Piloting/EDU 10+. A failed check requires another attempt, or the ship will misjump (see below). It is possible to calculate a jump plot in advance, but it will become obsolete within 1D days.
2.	Engage Drive: Once the jump plot is ready, the ship’s engineer must throw Engineering/EDU 8+ to engage the Jump Drive. This procedure takes a second and can be done in the same round as the jump throw itself.
3.	Jump!: To jump, throw 2D with the following DMs. A throw of 0 or less causes a misjump. A bad jump plot causes an automatic misjump.
DM+the Effect of the Engineering throw to Engage the Drive
DM-1 per day the jump plot is out of date
DM-2 if the Jump Drive is damaged.
DM-2 if using Unrefined fuel.
DM-8 if within a hundred-diameter limit of the nearest planet or star (Not at a jump point)
4.	In Case of a Misjump: A misjump causes a Critical Hit on the ship (see the space combat rules) and may destroy it. Furthermore, the ship travels 1D x 1D parsecs in a random direction. If this leads to an empty hex on the map, the ship emerges from the misjump at the closest star system to that empty hex. In case there are multiple adjacent systems, choose one randomly.

Starship Expenses
A starship’s owner must handle several expenses, detailed below.

Mortgage
A mortgaged ship’s owner must pay 1/320th of the ship’s cash price per month for 480 months (40 years). This means that the owner pays 150% of the ship’s purchase price back to the bank.

Crew Salaries
A ship needs the following crew-members:
Captain: Cr6,000 per month if hired (i.e., when the captain is not the ship’s owner/operator). The captain leads the crew and manages the ship and requires at least Leadership 1. Any crew member can serve as captain in addition to another job (at no additional pay), but this limits their capability to lead the crew in battle or other emergency. Furthermore, a ship can have a captain without the Leadership skill, but such captain will be unable to use the special captain actions described in the Space Combat chapter. A dedicated, skilled captain is essential if the ship expects combat.
Pilot: Cr6,000 per month. Requires at least Piloting 1. The Pilot flies and maneuvers the ship, as well as plots interplanetary movement and interstellar jumps. Every ship requires a pilot. Military ships will have more than one pilot in the event of crew casualties.
Sensor Operator: Cr3,000 per month. Requires at least Computer 1. Many civilian ships forgo this position and have the pilot operate the ship's sensors, but this limits their utility in the case of emergency or combat. For this reason, military vessels will have dedicated sensor operators. A ship can have a single Sensor Operator, though military craft often carry multiple Sensor Operators in the event of crew casualties.
Engineer: Cr4,000 per month. Requires at the Engineering skill at level 1. The Engineer maintains the ship and operates its drives. Any ship must have at least one engineer with Engineering 1 per 35 tons of drives and power plant. An engineer with Engineering 2 could run 70 tons of drives and power plants. Ships with less than 35 tons of drive and power plant do not require a full-time engineer. On larger ships, the engineer may have assistants, who are also required to have at least Engineering-1 so that there is one level of Engineering per 35 tons of drives and power plant.
Medic: Cr3,000 per month. Requires at least Medicine 1. At Medicine 2 or better, the Medic is referred to as the Surgeon. The Medic provides medical care to passengers and crew and oversees any Low Berths. Any legitimate ship carrying passengers requires a Medic, and many ships without passengers employ one to care for the crew. Each level of the Medicine skill allows the Medic to care for 50 crew and passengers.
Purser: Cr3,000 per month. Requires at least Administration 1. The Purser manages the ship’s accounts and supplies. This position is often combined with another job, usually the Steward, with no additional pay. Smaller ships with a single Steward rarely have a Purser.
Gunner: Cr1,000 per month. Requires at least Gunnery 1. Any armed ship requires one gunner per turret unless the guns are automated.
Security and Marines: Cr1,000 per month. Requires at least Gun Combat 1. This position is optional.  Security personnel protect a civilian starship against criminals and pirates. They are most often called upon to handle rowdy passengers. Military ships often carry marines for boarding actions and planetary operations.
Steward: Cr1,000 per month. Requires at least Steward 1. Any ship carrying passengers requires one or more Stewards to care for passengers., as described later in this chapter.

Fuel
Interstellar jumps require liquid hydrogen fuel. Starports rated A or B sell refined fuel at Cr500 per ton. Starports rated A to D sell unrefined fuel at Cr100 per ton. Military or exploration ships usually have on-board fuel processors capable of refining fuel; small commercial ships often avoid using refineries to save cargo space and because the purification process is too long to be economically viable.
Ships may refuel, free of charge, by two other means:
A ship can draw water from any world with a hydrographic rating of 1 or higher. Fuel extracted in this manner is unrefined. Most worlds with starports discourage or ban this practice, but it is a common practice on the frontier. Consider water drawn in this manner Unrefined Fuel. Drawing water takes 1 hour per 20 tons of water.
A ship can scoop gas giants for hydrogen fuel. Fuel gathered in this manner is unrefined. This takes 1D hours per 40 tons of fuel. Note that gas giants are a favorite ambush spot for pirates. Fuel scooped from a gas giant is Unrefined.
Fuel processors, if installed, can refine unrefined fuel into refined fuel. A ton of fuel processing equipment can refine 5 tons of unrefined fuel into refined fuel per day.

Life Support
Each person, passenger, or crew incurs a cost of Cr2,000 per month for life support, other expenses, and overhead. Luxury life support—gourmet food and other luxurious amenities—costs Cr4,000 per month. Note that High Passage does not require luxury life support. However, advertising luxury life support grants an additional die to the High Passenger availability roll at Starports rated C or better on the Available Freight and Passengers Table below.
Each occupied Low passenger berth costs Cr100 per month for life support in standard travel. Low berth occupants can survive much longer – decades or more – without external life support by putting the passenger into Deep Freeze,  but that imposes DM-2 penalty on their revival throws.
Purchasing life support in bulk reduces costs and allows the ship to operate for a longer time away from port. A ton of life support supplies – enough for 20 persons for a month – costs Cr34,000 instead of Cr40,000.

Port Fees
A starport berth costs Cr100 for 6 days, and Cr100 per day afterwards.

Maintenance
Ships require maintenance work at a starport rated C or better once per year. This costs 0.1% of the ship’s listed price. If the ship skips maintenance, the Engineer must throw Engineering/INT 8+ each month to avoid a mishap; each mishap means that a single ship system has broken down: roll a single combat Hit and apply the damage to the vessel. Apply a DM-1 for every additional month of maintenance skipped. However, reroll any "Critical Hit" results rolled in this case: ships do not explode due to faulty maintenance. At least, not normally.

Starship Revenue
Ships generate revenue by carrying passengers, freight, mail, or by hiring out as charters. Speculative trade, described in the Speculative Trade chapter, can also generate revenue.

Passage
There are five types of ship passage tickets. Prices are per parsec traveled. For example, traveling two parsecs by Jump-2 by Middle Passage would cost Cr16,000 and take one week. The same ticket bought on a Jump-1 ship would cost the same but take 2 weeks minimum.
Roll on the Available Freight and Passengers table below for available passengers of each class going to a destination world. A ship may remain in port to look for more passengers; roll again every 3 days after the first six, but they must now use the new number of passengers, even if that number is lower than originally rolled. A ship can take on all or part of the available passengers. Roll an additional die for High Passengers if luxury life support is available.

High Passage is first-class travel with excellent service and cuisine, and costs Cr10,000 per parsec travelled. The baggage allowance is 1000kg. The ship’s Steward can serve 3 High Passengers during the journey per level of the Steward skill. Steward-0 does not count for the purposes of tending to High Passengers. For example, Steward-2 allows the steward to care for up to 6 High Passengers. It is normal for a ship to “bump” a Middle Passenger or two Steerage Passengers in favor of a late-arriving High Passenger. In this case, the bumped passenger’s ticket is refunded, but there is no further compensation.
Middle Passage is standard travel with normal service and cuisine, and costs Cr8,000 per parsec travelled. The baggage allowance for Middle Passage is 100kg.  The Steward may serve 6 Middle Passengers for each level of Steward skill. Steward-0 does not count towards tending Middle Passengers.
Steerage Passage is economy-class travel at double occupancy (2 passengers per stateroom) with simple self-service cuisine. Steerage costs Cr3,000 per parsec traveled. The baggage allowance for Steerage is 20kg. Each level of the Steward skill, including Steward-0, allows the steward to serve 12 Steerage passengers.
Low Passage means traveling in cryo-sleep. This is unsafe, but cheap, and costs Cr1,000 per parsec traveled. The baggage allowance for Low Passage is 10kg. Cryo-sleep is dangerous and potentially lethal. The ship’s Medic throws Medicine/EDU 6+ to safely thaw and revive Low Passengers. Apply the passenger’s END DM to this throw as well. Failure means that the passenger dies from cryogenic shock. In the absence of a medic, the low berth (cryotube) itself can revive its occupant with an effective Medicine skill of 0 and an INT modifier of +0. A natural throw of 2 always kills the Low Passenger, regardless of the Medic’s abilities or the passenger’s END.
A ship’s captain may hire an individual to fill a vacant position on a starship by arranging Working Passage. This provides the passenger with free travel, accommodations, and food in exchange for working at that shipboard post. The baggage allowance is 1000kg. Labor laws often require that the captain hire the passenger on as crew at full salary if they continue to work for more than three jumps.
Stowing Away on a starship is ill-advised. If caught and handed over to the authorities, the stowaway will go to prison. Some captains avoid the hassle of dealing with planetary legal bureaucracies by throwing the stowaway out of the airlock, or selling them to slavers or organ-leggers.

Note that each level of Steward skill can serve either 3 High Passengers, or 6 Middle Passengers, in addition to 12 Steerage passengers. For determining the maximum number of passengers, a steward can tend to, consider each level of Steward skill as a point: each point can be allocated to serve only one class of passengers.
For example, a steward with the Steward-1 skill can serve 3 High Passengers, or 6 Middle Passengers, or 24 Steerage Passengers (since Steward 0 can cover 12 Steerage already). That same steward could not manage 2 High Passengers and 2 Middle Passengers. A steward with Steward-2 may serve 6 High Passengers, or 12 Middle Passengers, or 36 Steerage Passengers – or 3 High Passengers, 6 Middle Passengers and 12 Steerage passengers, or 3 High Passengers, and 24 Steerage Passengers, and so on.

*Round down
The above availability numbers assume a tramp freighter with no fixed schedule. The Referee should allow DMs if the ship sets up a regular schedule between worlds. Rates are in Credits per Parsec travelled.

Bulk Freight
A ship can transport cargo in bulk. This pays Cr1,000 per ton of cargo per parsec jumped. For example, transporting a ton of cargo in a single Jump-2 pays Cr2,000. Roll on the Available Freight and Passengers table above for available freight going to a given destination world. A ship may remain in port to look for more cargo; roll again every 3 days. A ship can take all or part of the available cargo. A ship may break up the available freight but must take the cargo in lots of each die rolled. For example, if the ship is at a Class B starport, there is 3Dx5 tons of freight available. The Referee rolls the 3D getting a 5, 3, and 6 – therefore, there are 3 available lots of freight 25 tons, 15 tons, and 30 tons. A ship’s Purser may select any or all of the lots but must take them in the full tonnage of each lot.

Mail and Incidentals
An armed merchant can sign up to carry 5 tons of mail. This pays Cr25,000 per parsec. Throw 1D-1 for the actual tonnage of mail carried (minimum 1 ton).
Other ships may carry private messages and parcels to a specific location. This pays Cr20 to Cr120 (Referee’s discretion) per message or parcel. As a rule of a thumb, one ton of cargo can contain up to 50 typical parcels. Messages are electronic, and the ship’s computer may hold an effectively limitless number of them.

Charters
A private individual or concern may charter a ship. Payment for in-system charters is Cr4 per ton of the ship per hour, with a 12-hour minimum. For example, a 100-ton scout would cost Cr400 per hour, minimum Cr4800. Payment for interstellar charters is in 2-week blocks at Cr3,000 per ton of cargo hold plus Cr24,000 per passage stateroom and Cr3,000 per low berth. The owner of the vessel still pays the overhead and supplies a crew. For example, a 100-ton Scout has four staterooms (Cr96,000), one low berth (Cr3,000), and 14 tons of cargo (Cr56,000) for a total potential of Cr155,000 for a charter of two weeks. Details of possible charters are left to the Referee.

Electronics and Sensors
All starships have a computer and assorted electronics and avionics. The computer model determines two things. The first is the highest jump rating the ship can achieve, and the other is a DM to all sensor throws, as shown in the following table.
Electronics and Sensors Table
Electronics	Max. Jump Rating	Sensor DM
Baseline	-	DM-4
Model/1	Jump-1	DM-2
Model/2	Jump-2	DM+0
Model/3	Jump-3	DM+1
Model/4	Jump-4	DM+2
Model/5	Jump-5	DM+2
Model/6	Jump-6	DM+3
Model/7	Jump-6	DM+4
Model/8	Jump-6	DM+5

Throw Computer/INT 8+ to use a ship’s sensors for scanning and detection purposes. Apply the ship’s Sensor DM to this throw. The Referee may determine various further DMs to this throw based on the task at hand.

Starship sensors automatically detect any civilian ship present in the local planetary system if it is using a transponder. Smugglers, pirates, and naval vessels often turn off such transponders and thus require a Computer/INT 8+ throw to detect at long range. A stealthed ship applies DM-4 to detection throws. Detecting small craft applies a further DM-2. Detecting ships at short range is done at DM+2.

Sensors are also useful in ship combat, as described in the Space Combat chapter.

Trade and Smuggling
A ship can generate a steady profit from hauling cargo and passengers. However, speculative trading offers a chance for far greater profits – at the risk of significant losses. The following simple system is designed to allow merchant traders to engage in speculative trade.

Speculative Trade Procedure
For speculative trade, follow the procedure below:
1. Find a supplier.
2. Determine goods available.
3. Determine purchase price.
4. Travel to a new world.
5. Find a buyer.
6. Determine sale price.

Remember the first rule of trading: Buy low, Sell high.

1. Find a supplier
Throw the listed skill below to find a supplier. If you fail the throw, you may look for additional suppliers, but at DM-1 per previous attempt per planet per week.
To find a corporate supplier, throw Liaison/SOC 8+.
To find a black-market supplier for illegal goods, throw Streetwise/INT 8+.
To find a private supplier, throw Carousing/SOC 8+.
DM+6 for Starport A; DM+4 for Starport B; DM+2 for Starport C; DM -1 for Starport D and DM-2 for Starport E.

2. Determine goods available
There are two types of goods – common and trade. A given supplier has all Common Goods and 1D randomly chosen trade goods. To the 1D roll, apply DM+1 if Starport C, DM+2 if Starport B, DM+4 if Starport A, or DM-2 if Starport E. This can never be less than one.  Throw “D66” on the following table to determine available trade goods. This means throwing 2D, but rather than adding them together, read them consecutively, that is – one as the “tens” digit and the second as the “ones” digit. Remember to declare which is which before rolling.
Ignore the results of 61-65 unless dealing with a black-market dealer – these goods are universally illegal or otherwise highly questionable.
If certain regular trade goods are illegal on a planet, a black-market supplier will offer them as well. The Referee should use the world’s Law Level as a guide to what is legal and illegal on a particular world.
Smuggling
Running contraband–such as results 61-65 on the trade table–means running the risk of being caught by the authorities. Apart from inspection by patrol boat in space, covered by the ship encounter rules earlier in this book, selling or buying illegal goods is likely to attract unwanted law enforcement attention:
To avoid an encounter with law enforcement while smuggling, throw 2D and get equal to or higher than the world’s Law Level. Failure means some police harassment. Such harassment does not necessarily mean that the characters were caught smuggling, but rather that they are in the risk of being caught; avoiding the Law in such a case is an adventure all by itself. The Referee can abstract this interaction to a single Streetwise or Admin throw to avoid trouble, or fully role-play the encounter.
In cases where goods are deemed illegal due to the local planetary Law Level (see the Worlds chapter), the Referee should apply a DM+1 or DM+2 to the Sale throw on the Modified Price Table, below.

3. Determine Purchase Price
Speculative purchase prices vary wildly based on local supply, political or economic conditions, and the suppliers themselves. To determine the purchase price, throw 2D on the Purchase column of the Modified Price Table, above. The throw is modified by the character’s INT or SOC DM (whichever is higher), and by the character’s Liaison skill level. Use whichever skill or attribute modifier is greatest and consult the Purchase Price column.  Further modify this result by a trade good’s Purchase DM based on the world of origin. Only one trade code applies to each transaction – in the case where multiple trade DMs apply to a single world, use the highest one.
Finally, modify the purchase price according to the Traffic and Safety modifiers.
Multiply the base price by the resulting purchase percentage to get the final purchase price per ton. Then multiply that price by the number of tons of goods within a lot to determine the final purchase price of that lot.
Like freight, Common Goods may be purchased in lots of a single die. However, other Trade Goods must be purchased in lots equal to the full tonnage rolled.

4. Selling Goods
The procedure for selling goods is the same as purchasing goods: find a buyer on a new planet using the same skills used to find a supplier. Roll 2D on the Modified Price Table and consult the Sale Price column. The throw is modified by the character’s INT or SOC DM (whichever is higher), and by the character’s Liaison skill level. Apply the highest Trade Good Sale DM for the world where the goods are being sold to the roll on the Sale Price table. Finally, apply the Traffic and Safety modifiers to the Sale Price column. Selling Characters may avoid selling goods to a certain buyer or on a certain world and may throw again as they search for another buyer after one week. Alternatively, they may try their luck on another world.

Traffic and Safety Modifiers
The Trade Goods have Purchase and Sale DMs that reflect the relative supply and demand realities of the world where those goods are being bought and sold. They are fairly comprehensive, but neglect to consider two important factors that impact prices: the relative amounts of traffic and safety that define the world. High traffic drives purchase and sale prices down, as there are more traders and more merchants competing on a given world. Conversely, worlds that see low traffic tend to have higher prices. As well, worlds that are increasingly unsafe see a dramatic rise in prices as fewer and fewer merchants engage in commerce on those worlds.
There are two ways to define traffic and safety levels in TevellerRPG. The “classic” way uses the Starport, and Zone Codes found in the UWP. A more qualitative method that we include here meshes with the Space Encounter rules found on p.XX, as well as in Stellagama Publishing’s Piracy and Privateering rulebook.

Local Brokers
A local broker, well-versed in the local market and well-connected to suppliers and buyers, can improve the trader’s chances to gain favorable prices. A broker adds a +DM to purchase and sale price throws but takes a commission from the transaction sum (always paid by the speculative trader). Brokers are always available, limited by the starport class, as noted below.

Ship Design and Construction
Starships come in many shapes, configurations, and sizes. Players will typically operate a small vessel, though larger-scale naval, exploration, or merchant-marine campaigns are also possible. This chapter presents a system for designing ships from scratch and for upgrading existing ships.
These rules classify ships by their volume rather than mass, for reasons of tradition and since the use of the magneto-gravitic maneuver drive makes volume a more important design consideration than mass. Ship designs note vessel sizes in displacement tons: this is how many tons of liquid hydrogen the ship displaces. 1 displacement ton (d-ton or ton, for short) equals approximately 14 cubic meters: a cube roughly 2.4m per side.  On a square grid map where each square is 1.5m per side and 3.0m high, each ton is represented by approximately two squares on the deck plan.
A note on tech levels: the default interstellar space-opera tech level in TevellerRPG is TL12. Ships designed at lower or higher Tech Levels are possible.
Also note that these rules present interstellar-level spacecraft designs at TLs 9-16, which are ideal for space-opera campaigns. Societies at TLs 6-8 can also manufacture spacecraft for intra-system travel, but these are considerably more primitive than the interstellar-era craft one can create with these ship construction rules. For the sake of brevity, we will not describe primitive craft here.

Ship Hull
Hulls cost MCr0.1 per ton. This is modified by the ship’s configuration, as given below. The largest available starship hull in TevellerRPG is 10000 tons.
Starships can be constructed at Class-A starports, system ships (which lack jump drives) and small craft (vessels under 100 tons) can be constructed at Class-A or Class-B starports. Use the following table to determine the construction time of a spacecraft.
Spacecraft Construction Times
Ship Tonnage	Construction Time (weeks)
<100 tons	26
100 – 500 tons	52
501 – 1000 tons	78
1001 – 2000 tons	120
2001 – 3000 tons	150
3001 – 4000 tons	180
4001 – 5000 tons	210
5001 – 10000 tons	300

Hull Configuration
There are three general starship hull configurations:
Standard: The ship is robust enough to enter an atmosphere but will maneuver very poorly. It cannot fly like an aircraft but only land and take off into space again. The ship may skim gas giants for fuel. No additional cost is required. All Pilot skill checks when flying in an atmosphere suffer a DM-2.
Streamlined: The ship will operate and maneuver like an aircraft in an atmosphere. The ship may skim gas giants for fuel and comes equipped with Fuel Scoops at no extra cost. Streamlined hulls cost 10% more than the standard price (MCr0.11 per ton).
Distributed: The hull is designed with only space operations in mind. The ship is non-aerodynamic and will break up if it enters an atmosphere denser than Trace. It may not skim gas giants for fuel; ships with distributed hulls will often carry small craft to interface with worlds. The hull costs 10% less than the standard price (MCr0.09 per ton).

Ship Armor
Ships armor is available as Light Armor and Heavy Armor. Armor affects the performance of anti-ship weapons and may even prevent damage completely from lighter weapons.
Ships of 1000 tons or more automatically increase armor by one increment: treat an unarmored 1000+ ton ship as having Light Armor, a lightly armored 1000+ ton ship as having Heavy Armor, and a heavily armored 1000+ ton ship as having Massive Armor (a category only available for such large ships).

Light Armor
The following table lists how many tons of space Light Armor occupies and how much it costs by Tech Level.

Light Armor Technology
Armor Type	TL	Tonnage	Cost
Titanium Steel	7	12.5% of ship tonnage	12.5% of base hull cost
Composite Alloy	8	10% of ship tonnage	20% of base hull cost
Crystaliron	10	6.5% of ship tonnage	25% of base hull cost
Superdense	12	5% of ship tonnage	30% of base hull cost
Bonded Superdense	14	4% of ship tonnage	40% of base hull cost
Collapsed Superdense	16	3.5% of ship tonnage	50% of base hull cost

Heavy Armor
The following table lists how many tons of space Heavy Armor occupies and how much it costs by Tech Level.

Heavy Armor Technology
Armor Type	TL	Tonnage	Cost
Titanium Steel	7	25% of ship tonnage	25% of base hull cost
Composite Alloy	8	20% of ship tonnage	40% of base hull cost
Crystaliron	10	12.5% of ship tonnage	50% of base hull cost
Superdense	12	10% of ship tonnage	60% of base hull cost
Bonded Superdense	14	8.5% of ship tonnage	80% of base hull cost
Collapsed Superdense	16	7% of ship tonnage	100% of base hull cost



Stealth
Specialized emissions-masking systems and stealth structures can render a ship difficult to detect by sensors at any range. Stealth costs MCr0.1 per ton of the ship’s hull. Stealth modifications provide DM-4 to any Computer throws to detect or lock onto the ship in and out of combat.

Drives
A system ship must have a maneuver drive (M-Drive) and a power plant (P-Plant). A starship must have a jump drive (J-Drive) and a power planet (P-Plant); a maneuver drive may also be installed but is not required. Small craft are too small to mount jump drives.
On the Drive Performance tables, the maneuver drive potential is the Thrust number (Tn), measured in the number of G’s of acceleration available. For Jump Drives, the potential is the Jump number (Jn), or Jump range in parsecs. The power plant rating code must be at least equal to either the maneuver drive or Jump drive rating, whichever is higher.
Drives use a percentage of ship’s tonnage. Note that higher tech levels can produce more efficient drives.
Drive and power plant performance is not linear. Small and exceptionally large components tend to be less efficient than moderately sized units. This is especially true with small craft drives, which are significantly less efficient than those of starships (100+ tons).
Note that Performance of “0” represent station-keeping ability only, no tactical maneuvering. Often used by space stations and orbital facilities. Also note that while a space station might have Maneuver Drive 0, it must have at least Power Plant 1 to operate.
Drive Cost: Jump drive, Maneuver drive, and Power Plant components cost MCr1.5 per ton.
Small Craft Drives (10–99-ton hull)

J-Drive		2.0	1.4	1.2	1.0	0.9	0.8	0.7	0.6

Jump Technology
While all magneto-gravitic maneuver drives and fusion power plants are available from TL9 on, jump technology develops more gradually, as follows. Remember that the ship’s computer also determines the ship’s maximum jump rating.

Jump Rating	Minimum Tech Level
1	9
2	11
3	12
4	13
5	14
6	15

Fuel
Fusion power plants include their own fuel, typically Helium-3. Power plant fuel suffices for over a year; annual maintenance costs include the expense of refueling the power plant. However, jump drives require liquid hydrogen fuel for each jump. When performing a jump, a starship uses 10% of its tonnage in fuel per parsec jumped. To determine how much fuel a given jump consumes, multiply the starship’s tonnage by 0.1, and then multiply that number by the number of parsecs being travelled in the jump. For example, a 100-ton starship performing Jump 2 must expend 100 x 0.1 x 2 = 20 tons of fuel to operate its jump drive.

Starship Bridge
Any ship of 100 tons or more has a bridge based on its total tonnage. The size of the bridge is 2% of the hull tonnage and costs MCr0.5 per 100 tons of ship. This tonnage also includes avionics and communication equipment, especially in larger ships. Minimum bridge tonnage is 10 tons for a starship and 5 tons on a system ship.

Small craft cockpit and accommodations
A small craft control cabin or cockpit costs MCr0.1 per 20 tons of craft. A cockpit is cramped and will be uncomfortable for more than 24 hours of continuous use. Apply a DM-1 to skill checks in those cases. A control cabin is far more comfortable for longer journeys.
In addition, small craft may also mount acceleration couches, allowing them to carry passengers for short flights of 12 hours or less. These couches accommodate a single person each, displace 0.5 tons and cost Cr25000 (MCr0.025) per person. It is possible to install staterooms in small craft as well.
Note that small craft do not require additional electronics beyond the baseline model, though military and exploration craft greatly benefit from them.

Controls	Tonnage
1-Person Cockpit	1.5 tons
2-Person Cockpit	3 tons
1-Person Control Cabin	3 tons
2-Person Control Cabin	6 tons
For each extra person after the first two in a Control Cabin, add 2 tons and MCr0.05 (twice the cost of an acceleration couch because they also have some control capability). Only control cabins can have this added feature. Each cockpit or cabin includes Acceleration Couches for each occupant.

Electronics
Each ship has a central computer and various electronic systems. The computer core itself is exceedingly small; even with hardening and redundancy, this mainframe is rarely larger than a small 21st century beer refrigerator. The actual tonnage includes various electronic systems: wiring, terminals, sensors, and communication systems.
Electronics are required for calculating interstellar jumps. The computer included in an electronic system grant a DM to sensor throws in and out of combat. The electronics may also assist in targeting, as noted in the Space Combat chapter.
All electronic systems are hardened against radiation and electromagnetic pulses, though this hardening is neither perfect nor complete; see the radiation attack rules in the Space Combat section.
Starships need at least Model/1 electronics for jump calculations. Small craft may have baseline computers with minimal electronics: this is included in their cockpit costs and tonnage. However, baseline electronics are recommended only for civilian craft.
You may add an “Advanced” (adv) option to any electronics system. It increases the electronics cost by 50% but also permits the ship to have a maximum Jump rating one higher than what it would attain with standard electronics. For example, Model/1adv electronics would have a Sensor DM-2, cost MCr1.5, and take up 1 ton of space on board, but would allow a maximum of Jump-2.

Electronics	TL	Cost	Tonnage	Max. Jump Rating	Sensor DM
Baseline	-	-	-	-	DM-4
Model/1	7	MCr1	1	Jump-1	DM-2
Model/2	9	MCr3	2	Jump-2	DM+0
Model/3	11	MCr5	3	Jump-3	DM+1
Model/4	12	MCr10	5	Jump-4	DM+2
Model/5	13	MCr20	6	Jump-5	DM+2
Model/6	14	MCr40	8	Jump-6	DM+3
Model/7	15	MCr50	10	Jump-6	DM+4
Model/8	16	MCr100	12	Jump-6	DM+5

Armament
Military craft, as well as civilian craft operating on the frontier, often carry weaponry. Each weapon requires one or more hardpoints to mount on a ship. Ships have one hardpoint available per 100 tons of hull size. Fire control is included in the turret or bay tonnage amounts listed below.
Ship weapons have the following stats:
Weapon: weapon’s name.
TL: minimum tech level to construct the weapon.
Type: the weapon’s type, whether it is Light, Intermediate, Heavy, or a Main Gun.
Hits: the number of internal damage rolls the weapon inflicts on the appropriate damage table. Radiation damage rolls apply regardless of armor rating unless the ship is completely invulnerable to that weapon’s class.

Turrets
One turret may be attached to each hardpoint on the ship.
Turret Displacement and Cost
Weapon	TL	Tons	Cost (MCr)
Single Turret	7	2	0.2
Double Turret	8	3	0.5
Triple Turret	9	4	1
Pop-Up Turret	10	x2	+1
Fixed Mounting	-	-	x0.5

Single, Double and Triple turrets can hold one, two, or three weapons, respectively.
Pop-Up is a quality that can be applied to any type of turret. The turret is concealed in a pod or recessed on the hull and is detectable only when deployed. A ship with all its weapons in pop-up turrets looks unarmed to a casual sensor scan. Pop-up turrets take up twice as much tonnage as their normal counterparts and add MCr1 to the turret’s cost.
Fixed Mounting weapons cannot move and are limited to firing in one direction: usually fixed forward, or fixed rear. Fixed mountings are found mainly on small craft. A fixed mounting costs half as much as a turret with the same number of weapons. See the Space Combat chapter for rules on how to fire Fixed weapons.
Turrets and fixed mounts can accommodate a variety of weapon systems. The legality and availability of a given weapon system is beyond the scope of these construction rules. The Referee should be the final arbiter of what is considered normal, legal, licensed, or illegal in their setting. Remember, the rules will not be same in every star system and starship crews must be careful to ensure they comply with local regulations. In almost every case, nuclear weapons are restricted to military use only.
Weapons
Weapons may be installed in Turrets, Bays, or as Main Weapons. Not every weapon can be installed in all mounting systems at the same tech level, see the tables below for details.
Regular missiles cost Cr1,200 each; smart missiles, Cr2,500 each; nuclear missiles, Cr50,000 each but are not normally available to civilians. Smart missiles are accurate, regardless of the gunner’s skill. If they miss their target, they may make one more attempt to hit in the following round. Nuclear missiles are Intermediate weapons and cause 2D hits + 1 radiation hit. Ortillery missiles attack ground targets and cost Cr5,000 per missile. See the Space Combat chapter for missile attack procedures.
A single missile rack holds 3 missiles, and each ton of cargo space modified as a missile magazine can accommodate 12 missiles. Loading a rack from nearby ordinary cargo takes the gunner a full space combat round. A pre-designated missile magazine allows automatic loading but prevents that space from being used for cargo when not carrying missiles.
Torpedoes are larger military-grade guided weapons. They pack an enormous punch, but are vulnerable to spoofing and point defense, like normal missiles. A torpedo launcher holds one torpedo, while torpedo bays fire salvoes of 12 torpedoes. Each torpedo costs Cr5,000, and each ton of cargo space can hold 6 torpedoes. Like missiles, pre-designated torpedo magazines allow for automatic reloading, but prevent the space from being used for cargo at other times.
Pulse lasers are ideal for point defense against incoming missiles. They are powerful but inaccurate, causing 2 hits on impact, but attacking at DM-2 to hit ordinary targets. See the Space Combat chapter for rules on point defense.
Mining Lasers are a tool more than a weapon. Belters use these lasers to penetrate asteroids and reach valuable ores. Salvagers also use mining lasers to enter derelict ships or cut the ships up for parts. In a pinch, mining lasers can be used as a potent short-range weapon: they suffer DM-3 to all attack rolls when used as a weapon.
Sandcasters launch anti-laser sand canisters, described in the Ship Combat chapter. A single sandcaster holds 6 canisters and a single ton of cargo, or magazine, can hold 24 canisters. Sandcaster magazines can serve for sand canisters just as for missile magazines, and a single magazine can be used for both interchangeably, at an exchange rate of two canisters per missile.
Particle Beams blast enemies with beams of charged particles, causing both structural and radiation damage. This is the lightest military-grade energy weapon available, and many polities restrict its use to military and paramilitary ships.
Beam Lasers are weak but accurate lasers firing continuous beams.
Plasma Beams: are powerful beam weapons firing ionized plasma.
Fusion Beams: beam weapons emitting plasma undergoing a fusion reaction.
Gravity lances fire shearing beams of gravitons which are exceedingly powerful, but attack rolls are affected by the hull configuration: Streamlined: DM-2, Distributed: DM+2.
Meson cannons fire streams of exotic particles that decay inside the hull of the target ship. They are notoriously inaccurate, but when they hit, they can cause tremendous damage. Meson cannons ignore armor but are affected by meson shields.
Cherenkov cannons fire a stream of particles that are moving faster than the speed of light in the local medium (tachyons) and can easily penetrate armor. Reduce target’s armor rating by one category against this weapon.

Large Weapons
Large weapons are turret-mounted weapons, used almost exclusively by military ships. A single large weapon can fit in a triple turret and takes up all the turret’s space. These larger weapons are designed to penetrate low armor values and are commonly found on escorts and frigates. The following large weapons are available.

Bays
A bay weapon is a massive, military-scale gun emplacement designed for large-scale naval warfare. Each bay displaces 50 tons and uses 5 hardpoints. The following bay weapons are available.

Main Guns
A large starship may carry massive, fixed-mounted, Main Guns in addition to its turrets and bays. A main gun displaces 1000 tons and requires ten hardpoints. There are three types of main guns, Particle Gun, Meson Gun, and Gravitic Disruptor. Note that the Meson Cannon and Gravitic Disruptor ignore armor.

Shields
Shields are defensive energy systems that protect against specific attacks.

Shields
Shield	TL	Effect	Tons	Cost (MCr)
Meson Shield	12	Protects against meson weapon damage, halving the number of hits inflicted by a meson weapon (rounded down). Meson shields prevent radiation damage from meson weapons.	50	60
Nuclear Damper	12	Halves fusion gun and nuclear missile hits (rounded down), removes automatic radiation hit from fusion and nuclear missile attacks.	50	50
Gravitic Field	13	Uses gravitic pulses to deflect incoming attacks, halving the hits from all weapons, but imposes a DM-1 on all outgoing attacks. At TL14, ignore the attack penalty.	100	100
Force Field	16	Ignores one attack, regardless of its power; this depletes the shield. Roll 1D on the following round. The Field regenerates on 4-6. Check each round until it regenerates.	200	300

Ship Crew
All vessels require a crew to operate and maintain the ship. A single person can run a 100-ton ship if they have the requisite skills, though a larger crew is advisable. Larger ships require larger crews.

Small Craft Crew
Each small craft requires a pilot, who can also fire the small craft's weapons. A dedicated gunner allows more complex gunnery actions, as given in the Space Combat chapter.

Ship Crews
Any ship requires a pilot to fly and steer the ship, as well as plot its course and calculate jumps. These tasks all require the Pilot skill. Military ships often have 3 pilots, working in four or eight hour shifts for constant monitoring of the flight controls and sensors, when not in jump space.
Some civilian ships and all military ships have a sensor operator, using the Computer skill. On smaller civilian ships, the pilot often fulfills this role, though this limits the utility of sensors in emergency or combat. All military ships carry a sensor operator, and sometimes at least three of them to ensure round-the-clock sensor monitoring.
All ships require one engineer per 35 tons of drives and power plant. Ships with less than 35 tons of drives and power plant, as well as small craft, do not require dedicated engineers, as their drives are small enough for the Pilot to handle during flight. However, an Engineer may be beneficial in ship combat. Engineers need the Engineering and Repair skills.
Any ship carrying passengers requires one or more stewards. See the discussion of Stewards in the Ship Revenue section.
Larger ships must have a medic to tend to the health of passengers and crew. Even ships without passengers often carry a medic to maintain the crew's health and handle medical emergencies. There must be one medic per 50 crew and passengers carried, including low passengers. Dedicated medbays require additional medical staff.
Each gun turret requires a gunner to operate it. Weapon bays require two gunners, while main guns require ten gun crewmembers each. Each shield requires one gunner. Ships with Model/2 or better electronics may automate turrets: one turret per Sensor DM bonus (including DM+0) can be automated. For example, a ship with sensor bonus DM+2 could automate three turrets; the computer has a Gunnery-1 skill. Weapons bays, main guns, and screens cannot be automated. In accordance with naval doctrine, most military craft prefer living gunners for all weaponry and defenses.
Military ships often carry marines, as well as flight crew – one pilot and one support crew per small craft on board. Larger civilian ships often have a purser and security staff aboard as well. Note that small craft pilots and service personnel are optional – many civilian starships do not have such dedicated personnel for their small craft.
All ships have a captain, though on smaller ships this is usually a part-time job performed by the pilot in addition to their regular duties. A dedicated captain is ideal for combat vessels and all-but-required on all military vessels.

Accommodations
The standard accommodations for ship crews are one stateroom per crew member. A stateroom displaces 4 tons and costs MCr0.5.
Military ships and more rugged freighters often institute a policy of double occupancy: housing two crew members or passengers in each stateroom. This does not increase the stateroom cost but is quite cramped. Highly skilled or senior civilian crew members and military officers usually get their own staterooms. Double occupancy for all crew except for the bridge crew or even for just the captain is standard practice on smaller military ships.
High and Middle Passage passengers require their own staterooms. Steerage class passengers always travel in double occupancy, unless the ship takes off with an odd number of Steerage class passengers, in which case the captain will organize a draw and one Steerage class passenger will have their own stateroom at no additional cost.
Cryotubes carry Low Passage passengers in cold sleep. Cyrotubes also serve as emergency transport and for carrying prisoners or captured lifeforms. A cryotube displaces 0.5 tons and costs MCr0.05.
Emergency cryotubes carry four persons each, who all share the same risky revival throw as noted in the Passage Section. They serve in emergencies, as well as for transporting large livestock. Most polities forbid carrying passengers in emergency cryotubes in non-emergency situations. Each displaces 1 ton and costs MCr0.1

Each ship is built with one standard airlock per 100 tons as part of the hull at no additional cost. Small craft do not come with airlocks standard. Additional airlocks are 1 ton and cost MCr0.2 each.
Military ships often carry an armory, providing military-grade small arms, armor, and equipment. Each 2-ton block of armory costs MCr0.5 and equips 10 marines.
A ship may use a breaching tube to breach and board a disabled enemy ship, that is, an enemy ship without an operable Maneuver Drive. A breaching tube takes up 3 tons of space and costs MCr3.
Fuel processors can refine unrefined fuel into refined fuel. A ton of fuel processing equipment can refine 5 tons of liquid hydrogen per day. Processors cost MCr0.1 per ton.
All streamlined ship hulls have built-in fuel scoops for collecting hydrogen fuel from gas giants. For ships with standard hulls, installing fuel scoops cost MCr1 and do not displace any tonnage.
Every ship has a galley (kitchen and lounge) and a medbay. These are included in stateroom tonnage and costs. A medbay counts as a medical facility for the purposes of healing wounds. A basic medbay accommodates up to 2 patients. A dedicated medlab, costing MCr2 and displacing 8 tons, represents better, hospital-grade care. Medlabs grant DM+1 to all Medicine tasks and allow doctors to perform Trauma Surgery without penalties for working in the field. Each additional 2 tons and MCr0.25 allocated allows another patient. Medlabs require one medic per 4 patients.
A laboratory is useful for scientific research, and comes in 4-ton blocks, each costing MCr1. A laboratory provides DM+1 to Science throws by the scientist using it. At the Referee's discretion, a laboratory is required for advanced or obscure scientific investigation.
Every ship includes a ship’s locker, which contains various technical and survival supplies, space suits, and civilian small arms such as pistols and shotguns. We recommend that the Referee determine the exact contents of the ship’s locker only when the players wish to access it. In any case, access to the ship’s locker is usually controlled by biometric lock, keyed to the captain or other senior crew.
Ships may carry small craft and vehicles. The space allocated for a small craft or vehicle does not include space for spare parts or other maintenance equipment. All spares and equipment must be carried as cargo.
Most starships carry escape pods, which displace 0.5 tons and cost MCr0.1 per passenger or crew.
Mining Equipment, displace 10 tons and cost MCr2 per drone bay, and allow a ship to mine asteroids. Each bay of mining equipment includes the mining drones and machinery to process 1Dx10 tons of asteroid per working day. The tonnage allocated also includes ore handling machinery, allowing the ship to take on ore and transfer it to the cargo bay.
Probe drones, displacing 1 ton and costing MCr0.2 per 5 drones, are designed for planetary surveying. The ship drops them from orbit in disposable re-entry capsules; they must be recovered manually. Alternatively, a probe drone in orbit can serve as a survey and communication satellite.
Repair drones displace 1% of the ship’s hull and cost MCr0.5 per ton of drones. The complement of drones allows the ship to make one free repair attempt per space combat round. The drones have Repair 1 and Engineering 1 and can only perform or assist the Damage Control action. See the Space Combat chapter. Cost includes software.

Carried Vehicles
Starships may carry regular vehicles on board. Space allocated for vehicles includes access space and space for basic maintenance equipment. Parts for maintenance need to be stored separately.


Cargo and Final Cost
The designer can now allocate any remaining tonnage to the ship’s cargo bay.
Add up the cost of various components for the ship’s final cost. Mass-produced ships enjoy a 10% discount to the final cost.
The question whether a ship is mass-produced is left to the Referee. Custom ships designed by players should not be mass-produced, as compared to standard models pre-designed by the Referee.
