World Generation
Countless worlds await the hardy adventurer or intrepid explorer. This chapter provides quick and simple rules for generating worlds and subsectors of space with several worlds in them.

Star Mapping
These rules greatly abstract astrography by using two-dimensional star maps to represent three-dimensional space. The standard map is a subsector, 8 hexagons wide and 10 hexagons long. Each of those hexagons represents a parsec (3.26 light years), which is roughly the size of one solar system. 2 by 2 subsectors form a quadrant of 16x20 hexagons, and 4 by 4 subsectors (2 by 2 quadrants) are a sector of 32 by 40 hexagons. Blank subsector, quadrant, and sector maps are readily available for free on-line; a blank subsector map is supplied here.
[insert blank subsector map page.
When randomly generating a subsector, a world is normally present in each subsector hexagon on a throw of 4+ on 1D. If a world is present, it has a gas giant in its system on a throw of 5+ on 2D. Gas giants are important for exploration as they allow accessible frontier refueling. The Referee is free to increase or decrease the target number to represent denser or sparser regions of space but remember: ships must have a star at each end of their jump, so a very sparse region of space might represent an unpassable boundary for lower tech interstellar civilizations.

World Creation
The process of creating worlds in TevellerRPG involves making a series of 2D roll and applying modifiers based on the planetary characteristic being generated. It is important to retain the rolled value, after all modifiers, for use with other characteristics. For example, the Size roll is used as a modifier for both the Atmosphere and Hydrographics rolls for the world.

Details of the mainworld in a system are determined using the following procedure:
1.	Roll World Size
2.	Roll Atmosphere, use the Size rating as a modifier
3.	Roll Hydrographics, use the Size rating as a modifier
4.	Roll Population
5.	Roll Government, use the Population rating as a modifier
6.	Roll Law Level, use the Government rating as a modifier
7.	Roll Starport, use the Population rating as a modifier
8.	Roll Tech Level, use all the above characteristics as modifiers
9.	Determine Trade Codes, use all the above characteristics as modifiers
10.	Determine Bases, use the Starport rating as a modifier
11.	Apply any Allegiances, trade lines etc. based on the setting
12.	Develop the world using everything above and your imagination.

Using random rolls to develop a world can create some very unusual, or even impossible, characteristic combinations. Most commonly, the world size might not support the other physical characteristics, or the population doesn’t match the habitability of the planet. The Referee should feel free to change any of these as needed, but we certainly encourage trying to figure out an interesting reason for the unusual conditions to exist.

Referees (and others) can use these world-building rules to create the main world, or most inhabited world, in each star system. These rules are not intended to create every planetary body in a given solar system. If the Referee wishes to add further to detail a star system, they could select the characteristics that make sense to them or find an online random system generator to do some of the heavy lifting for creating more details.

This process is designed to produce an interesting mix of worlds as might be found in a frontier subsector. Referees should adjust these rolls, especially the social characteristics of Population, Government, Starport, and even Tech Level to fit the setting they are creating.

World Size
Throw 2D-2 and consult the following table to determine the world’s Size rating.
Surface gravity is an approximation using Earth standard gravity (9.8m/s2) as one “g”.

World Size
Roll	Diameter	Surface gravity
0	Asteroid belt	Negligible
1	1600km	0.05g
2	3200km	0.15g
3	4800km	0.25g
4	6400km	0.35g
5	8000km	0.45g
6	9600km	0.7g
7	11200km	0.9g
8	12800km	1.0g
9	14400km	1.25g
10	16000km	1.4g


Atmosphere
Throw 2D-7 and add the world’s Size rating to determine the world’s Atmosphere rating. If a world’s Size rating is 0, the Atmosphere rating is also 0. The Atmosphere rating cannot be lower than 0 or higher than 15.

Atmosphere
Roll	Atmosphere	Survival Gear Required
0 -	Vacuum	Space suit
1	Trace	Space suit
2	Very Thin – Tainted	Breather with air supply
3	Very Thin	Breather with air supply
4	Thin – Tainted	Breather
5	Thin	-
6	Standard	-
7	Standard – Tainted	Breather
8	Dense	-
9	Dense – Tainted	Breather
10	Exotic	Breather with air supply
11	Corrosive	Space suit
12	Insidious	Space suit, Hostile Environment
13	Dense – High	Space suit in low altitudes
14	Thin – Low	Breather with air supplies at high altitudes; no protective equipment necessary at low altitudes
15+	Unusual	Varies

Atmosphere Notes
Vacuum: there is no atmosphere. Organic beings require a space suit to survive.
Trace: there is extremely low atmospheric pressure. Operating on the surface requires a space suit.
Tainted: an otherwise breathable atmosphere, except that it contains some elements harmful to humans. Breathing this atmosphere without a breather-mask causes 1D damage every 10 minutes.
Very Thin: low air pressure; humans require a Breather to condense the atmosphere to a breathable pressure. A very thin – tainted atmosphere uses both the breather's condenser function and filtration function.
Thin: low-pressure breathable atmosphere. Requires no protection gear but will be unpleasant for humans who are unused to the thin air.
Standard: Terra-like atmospheric pressure and composition. Best environment for humans.
Dense: high-pressure breathable atmosphere. Requires no protection gear but will be unpleasant for humans unused to the atmosphere.
Exotic: unbreathable by humans but otherwise harmless to them. Humans require an air supply to survive in Exotic atmospheres.
Corrosive: this atmosphere causes 1D damage per round to unprotected characters. Will breach a space suit in 2D hours.
Insidious: as Corrosive, but powerful enough to breach a space suit within 1Dx10 minutes. A Hostile Environment Space Suit provides protection against Insidious atmospheres for 2D hours.
Dense - High: thick N2/O2 atmosphere with deadly pressure at ground level; atmosphere is breathable and habitable at high altitude, such as on tall mountains. At lower altitudes, the pressure causes 1D damage per round to unprotected characters.
Thin - Low: a thin atmosphere that is only breathable at low altitudes, where higher atmospheric pressure can support unprotected human life. At higher altitudes, treat as a Very Thin atmosphere.
Unusual: left to the Referee’s discretion.

Hydrographics
Throw 2D-7 and add the world’s size roll to determine the world’s Hydrographic rating. The following DMs apply. A planet’s Hydrographic rating cannot be below 0 or exceed 10. Multiply the rolled value by ten to determine the percentage of the world’s surface that is covered by water. For example, a planet with a Hydrographics rating of 2 would have 20% of its surface covered by water.

Hydrographics DMs
Condition	DM
Size 0 or 1	Hydrographics must be 0
Atmosphere 0, 1, A, B, or C	DM-4
Atmosphere E	DM-2

Population
Throw 2D-2 to determine the world’s Population rating. This represents the order of magnitude of the world’s population. For example, Population 3 is thousands of inhabitants, Population 7 is tens of millions, and Population 9 is billions of inhabitants. The maximum Population is 10 (tens of billions of inhabitants) per world, except for extreme cases at the Referee's discretion.

Apply the following DMs:
Population DMs
Condition	DM
Unbreathable Atmosphere	DM-2
Standard Atmosphere	DM+3
Standard, Tainted Atmosphere	DM+1
Thin or Dense Atmosphere	DM+1
Hydrographics 0 and Very Thin or lesser Atmosphere	DM-1


Government
Throw 2D-7 and add the world’s population rating to determine its Government type, as described below. Worlds with a Population rating of 0 have no Government.

World Government
Roll	Government
0 -	None
1	Corporation
2	Participatory Democracy
3	Self-Perpetuating Oligarchy
4	Representative Democracy
5	Technocracy
6	Captive Government
7	Balkanized
8	Civil Service Bureaucracy
9	Impersonal Bureaucracy
10	Charismatic Dictator
11	Non-Charismatic Dictator
12	Charismatic Oligarchy
13	Religious Dictatorship
14	Religious Autocracy
15 +	Totalitarian Oligarchy

None: no government. Small family or loose clan structure if there is any population at all.
Corporation: rule by a corporation or other commercial enterprise.
Participatory Democracy: direct democratic rule by the entire population.
Self-Perpetuating Oligarchy: a small, self-contained group of people are in control.
Representative Democracy: republican rule by elected officials.
Technocracy: rule by unelected experts and professionals.
Captive Government: the government on the world answers to an external authority.
Balkanized: several governments and cultures exist on the same world. 21st century Terra is an example.
Civil Service Bureaucracy: government by agents selected for their relative competence.
Impersonal Bureaucracy: government by complex agencies insulated from the population.
Charismatic Dictatorship: governed by a single leader who enjoys popular support.
Non-Charismatic Dictatorship: governed by a single ruler who lacks popular support.
Charismatic Oligarchy: rule by a select group or organization enjoying popular support.
Religious Dictatorship: governed by a religious organization.
Religious Autocracy: rule by a single religious leader.
Totalitarian Oligarchy: governed by a clique controlling every facet of the population's lives.

Law Level
Throw 2D-7 plus the Government rating to determine the world’s Law Level, as described below. This represents how strict the world’s laws are and how stringently and widely they are enforced. If the world’s Government rating is 0, then its Law Level is also 0. The Law Level should never be less than 0 or greater than 10. Note that worlds that lack a population also lack a Law Level.

Law Level
Roll	Commonly Forbidden Weapons
0-	Lawless. All weapons allowed. Candidate for Amber Zone status.
1	Poison gas, explosives, undetectable weapons, weapons of mass destruction
2	Portable energy weapons (unless mounted on ships)
3	Heavy Weapons
4	All automatic weapons
5	Personal concealed weapons
6	All firearms except for shotguns and stunners. Carrying weapons is discouraged.
7	Shotguns.
8	All bladed weapons, stunners.
9	Any weapons outside one’s residence. Candidate for Amber Zone status.
10+	Highly restrictive government. All weapons forbidden. Candidate for Amber Zone status.

Starport
Most inhabited worlds have starports which greatly facilitate travel and interstellar commerce. Many worlds will have more than one starport, but only the best starport is usually listed. Throw 2D-7 plus the world’s Population rating to determine the Starport Class, as detailed below. Worlds without a population will lack a starport unless the Referee chooses to place one as part of the setting.
Starport Table
Roll	Class	Description	Best Fuel	Annual Maint.	Shipyard	Possible Bases
2-	X	No Starport	None	No	None	None
3-4	E	Frontier	None	No	None	None
5-6	D	Poor	Unrefined	No	None	Scout
7-8	C	Routine	Unrefined	No	Can perform reasonable repairs	Scout
9-10	B	Good	Refined	Yes	Can construct non-jump-capable craft	Naval, Scout
11+	A	Excellent	Refined	Yes	Can construct starships	Naval, Scout
Class A starports comprise the finest and most extensive interstellar infrastructure there is. These ports have the best of everything: vast construction yards capable of manufacturing and repairing all types of starships, docking facilities for nearly any size of vessel, and amenities for travelers, traders, and crew alike. Class A ports always have extensive orbital facilities. Naval bases and occasionally Research and Scout bases may also be present.
Class B starports are good quality ports with construction facilities capable of manufacturing system ships. Additionally, these facilities can perform annual maintenance on starships. Class-B starports almost always have an orbital facility associated with them. They are well-equipped for handling interstellar trade and shipping. Naval, Research, and Scout bases may be present.
Class C starports are the ‘standard’ starport. They have reasonably good ground facilities and may have an orbital port depending on the volume of trade present. Class-C ports can perform most repairs on starships, but they do not have significant construction capability. Scout or Research bases may be present.
Class D starports have minimal landing facilities, and no orbital facilities. There are usually a few buildings, but no significant structures supporting visiting ships. Scout bases may be present.
Class E starports are very primitive: they are little more than a designated clear area and a marker beacon. If the tech level supports it, there may be landing lights.
Class X starports are not starports. There are no facilities, and no designated landing spots. Any visitors to the world must determine their own safe landing area.

A note on orbital facilities: Class A, B, and sometimes C starports include both ground and orbital facilities, with regular shuttle service between them. This allows ships with Standard or Distributed hull configurations to use the starport. Class D and E starports lack orbital facilities. Class X starports are not actually facilities.

Tech Level
Throw 1D, modified by all applicable DMs, to determine the world’s Tech Level, as discussed in the Equipment chapter. A world’s Tech Level cannot be below 0. On a world that enjoys significant interstellar trade, the Tech Level denotes local manufacturing capacity, but higher TL gear should be available at double cost. On isolated worlds, the lack of interstellar trade means that nearly all technology present on the world will conform to the world’s Tech Level. The DMs below can end up generating some high Tech Levels. It is strongly recommended that the Referee limit the maximum TL possible; usually TL 15.
Note that worlds with no Population also lack a Tech Level.

Tech Level DMs Table
Rating	Starport	Size	Atmosphere	Hydro.	Population	Gov.
0		+2	+1	+1		+1
1		+2	+1		+1	
2		+1	+1		+1

Humans and human-like aliens require a minimal technological level to live on certain worlds. If a world’s Tech Level is below the minimum required for survival on that world, increase it to the minimum value.

Minimum Tech Levels Table
Conditions	Minimum TL
Hydrographics 0 or 10, and Population 6 or higher	4
Atmosphere 4, 7, or 9. (Thin-Tainted, Tainted, or Dense Tainted)	5
Atmosphere 3- (Very Thin or less), or 10, 11, 12, 15 (Exotic, Corrosive, Insidious, or Unusual)	7

Trade Codes
Use the following table to determine the world’s Trade Codes from the world’s characteristics. The Trade Codes are important for generating Purchase and Sale prices as used in the Speculative Trade chapter. If a planet fulfills all the characteristics listed in a row below, then it gains the Trade Code for that row. Apply all Trade Codes for which the world qualifies. For example, a planet with Atmosphere 5, Hydrosphere 7 and Population 4 would not gain the Agricultural Trade Code (it would need a population between 5 and 7) but would gain the Garden and Non-Industrial trade codes.

Trade Codes Table
Classification	Code	Size	Atmo.	Hydro.	Pop.	TL
Agricultural	Ag		4-9	4-8	5-7	
Asteroid	As	0	0	0

Agricultural: a world with an environment fit for large-scale agricultural production. Agricultural worlds require Thin, Standard, or Dense Atmospheres, Tainted or not, Hydrographics of 40% to 80%, and populations between the hundreds of thousands and tens of millions.
Asteroid: an asteroid belt devoid of life but rich in minerals. Asteroids require Size of 0.
Barren: an uninhabited world with Population 0.
Desert: a world with a significant atmosphere but no surface water. Desert worlds have an Atmosphere of Very Thin or denser, including Tainted version, and Hydrographics of 0%.
Fluid Oceans: a world with seas of liquids other than water, such as methane or more complex hydrocarbons. Fluid Ocean worlds have an Atmosphere of Exotic or worse, and Hydrographics of 10% or higher.
Garden: a perfect world for Terran (or similar) life. This world is populated enough for agricultural production, but with a population small enough to avoid significant ecological disruption. Garden worlds have breathable Thin, Standard, or Dense Atmospheres, 40% to 90% Hydrographics, and Populations ranging from the tens of thousands to the hundreds of millions.
High Population: a world with a Population of billions (or more!) of residents.
High Technology: an advanced world capable of interstellar-era technology. A world with a Tech Level of 12 or higher.
Ice-Capped: a world where surface water exists as ice deposits, usually near the poles. Ice-Capped worlds have an Atmosphere of Trace or None and Hydrographics of 10% or more.
Industrial: a world dedicated to massive-scale industrial production, often at the expense of the environment. Industrial worlds have an Atmosphere of None, Trace, or Tainted and Populations of billions or more residents.
Low Population: an outpost or other sparsely-populated world. The world has a Population of a thousand or fewer people.
Low Technology: a primitive world with pre-industrial technology. These worlds have a Tech Level of 3 or less.
Non-agricultural: a world incapable of feeding its population by regular agriculture. Societies here may use synthetic food, hydroponics, and other techno-agricultural methods, but the people usually rely heavily on agricultural imports. Non-Agricultural worlds must have an Atmosphere of Very Thin or less, Hydrographics of 30% or less, and a Population of millions or more.
Non-industrial: a world lacking a significant industrial base. Non-Industrial worlds must have a Population between ten thousand and a million people.
Poor: a marginally-habitable world. Poor worlds have an Atmosphere between Very Thin and Thin, including Tainted versions, as well as having Hydrographics of 30% or less.
Rich: a comfortable world with a breathable atmosphere and no overcrowding. Rich worlds have an Atmosphere of Standard or Dense—never Tainted—and a population between one million and one hundred million people.
Water world: a world completely or almost completely covered by water. Water worlds have Hydrographics of 100%
Vacuum: a world with no atmosphere. Vacuum worlds are larger than 1600 km and have no Atmosphere.

Bases
Some systems have naval or scout bases. Others are pirate havens. Bases can help establish the subsector’s politics. For example, naval bases tend to appear along borders or on important core worlds, while scout bases are established near borders or on an open frontier. While the method below generates random bases, we strongly suggest the Referee might also place their own bases according to their vision of the setting.
A Naval Base is a military base or depot serving an interstellar navy. Naval craft can refuel and resupply at a naval base. On an independent world, a Naval Base indicates significant local naval might. Naval bases exist on worlds with Class A or Class B starports on a throw of 8+.
A Research Base is a facility dedicated to expanding the boundaries of known science. Corporations or governments often establish research stations to study interesting phenomenon. Often these bases are placed on out-of-the-way worlds to avoid prying eyes, or to contain the damage if something goes wrong. Research bases are present in systems with Class A, B, or C starports on a 2D roll of 10+; DM-2 for Class A starports.
A Scout Base is an exploration and communications outpost operated by a scout service. A scout base on an independent world represents well-organized exploration capabilities and efforts. Scout bases exist on worlds with starport Class D or better on a throw of 7+; DM-1 for a Class C starport, DM-2 for Class B starport, and DM-3 for Class A starport. Player characters with detached-duty Scout Ships can obtain fuel and repairs for free at scout bases.
A Pirate Base harbors raiders, corsairs, and other criminals. This is usually a small independent bandit hideout, but sometimes governments tolerate the existence of such bases to encourage raids against enemy shipping. A pirate base exists in a system without a naval base or a Class-A starport on a throw of 12+.
The following table lists shorthand codes for bases present in a star-system.
Base Codes
Bases	Code
Naval Base	N
Pirate Base	P
Research Base	R
Scout Base	S

Travel Zones
Most worlds are nominally civilized, though dangers can still lurk even on the safest core world. However, some worlds are far more dangerous than most. Interstellar organizations such as the Navy, the Scout Service, and the Explorers’ Society issue travel warnings regarding these treacherous worlds. Such warnings take the form of travel zones.
A world marked as an Amber Zone is unsafe for off-worlders. It might have a hostile environment or a particularly dangerous government; it might be experiencing a period of instability and strife. It could be run by criminals or could be filled with dangerous xenofauna. The Referee should mark worlds as Amber Zones if they have dangerous atmospheres (Corrosive or worse); unstable governments 0, 7, or 10 or higher; or a law level of 0 or 9+. The Referee may also designate worlds as Amber Zones for other reasons.
A Red Zone world is deemed so dangerous it is forbidden for non-military vessels to visit. The navy interdicts such worlds to prevent unauthorized landings. Marking worlds as Red Zones is left entirely up to the Referee’s discretion. The Referee should usually use this designation sparingly.

Allegiances
Depending on the setting, worlds may be independent, or may belong to a larger interstellar polity. Or it could be vacillating in its allegiances. Examples of interstellar states run the gamut from very loose confederations to mighty empires. The referee should mark the borders of such polities on the map, and note any sub-divisions (districts, provinces, duchies, etc.) within the borders.

Communication and Trade Routes
Interstellar governments always try to establish lines of regular communication between their member worlds. As well, commercial activity will create regular trade routes that connect viable trading worlds in a given subsector. Such connections should encompass only some of the worlds in the subsector. There should also be some unconnected, less frequently visited worlds for characters to explore. The Referee should indicate Communication and Trade routes on the subsector map.
Communication Lines should connect any two worlds with Class A Starports, as well as Class B Starports, with any naval bases, using the shortest possible routes. These represent the main arteries of interstellar administration and naval activity. Thus, they enjoy highly frequent military and civilian courier and passenger services. Distances should not exceed the Jump capability of the highest TL world in the communication network.
Trade Routes represent strong and profitable commercial ties. There are a few criteria that two worlds need to meet to establish a Trade Route between them:
1. the pair of worlds have at least one Trade Tag that appears in the same rows of the following table;
2. the two worlds are within 4 hexes of each other;
and 3. it is possible to connect the two worlds by a series of Jump-1 or Jump-2 routes.
If the pair of worlds meets the above three criteria, then a trade route connects them. The Referee should mark any trade routes in the subsector on the map. The specific effects of a communication or trade route are left to the Referee. However, systems connected by to trade routes are usually high-traffic systems for the purposes of speculative trade.

Trade Routes
First End Point	Second End Point
High Tech or Industrial	Asteroid, Desert, Ice-Capped, Non-Industrial
High Population or Rich	Agricultural, Garden, Water World

World Presentation
Once a world’s characteristics have been developed, the following format can be used. See Appendix B for an alternate way to present the world information called the Universal World Profile (UWP).

(World), located in hex (hex number) of the (name) subsector, has a diameter of (diameter) km and a surface gravity of (gravity) g. The atmosphere is (atmosphere type). The surface is covered with (hydrographics)% water/fluid (select one). The world has (population) citizens governed by a (government type). The government imposes a Law Level of (law level) restricting (law level restrictions) weapons. The average technology is (tech level). Trade is supported with a Class (starport class) starport and (bases) bases. The world has the following trade codes (trade codes). (add details, history, or other setting specific information).

Xenofauna Encounters
Many worlds bear life, and this creates ecosystems, food chains, and the creatures that populate them. Interstellar visitors entering such alien ecosystems encounter xenofauna – alien animals. The latter respond in a manner dictated by their instincts, from flight, to indifference, to trying to eat the hapless adventurer.
Alien beasts vary greatly; however, basic ecological functions show great similarity between worlds. There are four basic categories of animals, based on diet: herbivore, omnivore, carnivore, and scavenger. Each category has sub-categories depending on how the animal gets its food. The following animal generation system creates alien animals based on their ecological function, rather than their form. The animal’s exact form is up to the referee.
We encourage the referee to be creative and modify animals they might already know about, as they see fit. For example, poison and venom are common in the natural world here on Terra and would most likely be common on other words; the referee may give an animal a venom based on the poison rules later in this chapter. More radical variations of known creatures are also possible and encouraged. For example, the referee may devise a predator hunting by spitting thorns at its prey at high speed. In this case, they may decide that the animal’s attack will resemble a rifle. Psionic animals are also a possibility. Do not let the tables restrict you – they are merely tools to provide a baseline.

Animal Generation Process
Follow these steps to generate xenofauna.
1. Choose the animal’s habitat terrain and roll for its movement type.
2. Determine the animal’s ecological niche and subtype.
3. Determine size, stamina, lifeblood, and damage.
4. Determine weapons, armor, and base speed.

Terrain and Ecosystem
Terrain and the local ecosystem affect the types of creatures inhabiting them. Use the following table to determine the animal’s mode of locomotion. The result provides DMs for later tables based on terrain. Roll 1D and consult this table for the animal’s method of movement: A for Amphibious, F for Flying, S for Swimming, and W for Walking. The numbers following the movement type are further DMs to the animal’s size.

Animal’s Niche and Subtype
Choose one ecological niche for the animal, as desired or as required by an encounter table. The niches are Carnivore, Herbivore, Omnivore, or Scavenger. Throw 2D on the following table to determine the animal’s subtype. Subtypes also determine the creature’s speed, as detailed later in this chapter. The numbers in parentheses are the numbers of animals encountered per pack (or random encounter). If there is no number, only a single creature appears,

Animal Size, Stamina, Lifeblood, and Damage
For each creature, throw 2D for size, applying any size DMs from the Terrain and Movement table. Size determines the creature’s Lifeblood, Stamina, and damage. As for sentient beings, Stamina and Lifeblood indicate how much damage the animal can take. Throw for two numbers as indicated on the table. The first number is Stamina; the second is Lifeblood. The damage column modifies the amount of damage dice the animal’s attacks inflict. See the animal weapons table for the baseline damage. For example, if a weapon causes 2D damage by default but the “Damage Modifier” column indicated -1D, this animal’s weapon will only cause 1D damage. The entry “x2”, on the other hand, will modify the damage to 6D. If the table reduces a weapon’s damage dice to zero, and each attack causes only 1 point of damage.

Animal weapons, armor, and base speed
Throw 2D on the following table to indicate the animal’s natural weapon and base damage. DM+8 for carnivores; DM+4 for omnivores; DM-6 for herbivores. Animals with two different weapons attack twice. A +X after a weapon’s name indicates a positive DM to attack throws.

Animal Movement Speed
Finally, consult the following table to determine the animal’s movement speed. The table generates speed multipliers; multiply this by 10 (a human’s average walking speed) to get the animal’s speed in meters per combat round.

Animal Movement Speed
Type	Speed Multiplier	Minimum Speed (in m/action)
Carnivore		
Chaser	1D-2	20
Killer	1D-3	10
Pouncer	1D-4	10
Siren	1D-4	0
Trapper	1D-5	0
Herbivore		
Filter	1D-5	0
Grazer	1D-2	20
Intermittent	1D-4	10
Omnivore

Hijacker	1D-4	10
Intimidator	1D-4	10
Reducer	1D-4	10

 
Animal Reactions
The animal’s ecological subtype influences its reaction in encounters with people, such as colonists and adventurers. When characters provoke an animal, or simply enter the territory of a more aggressive species, throw 2D and consult the following table. An entry of “Attack 6+” and “Flee 3-”, for example, means that if the reaction roll is 6 or more the animal will attack, and if it is 3 or less, it will flee. If the roll is between these numbers, the animal ignores the characters until provoked again.
