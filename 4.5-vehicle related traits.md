Vehicle and Spacecraft Traits
Signature Vehicle
Prerequisite: Relevant Vehicle Skill 1, or Pilot 1
The character gains a DM+1 for all vehicle rolls for a specific named vehicle. Note that this trait does not apply to a class of vehicles (for example, “boats” with Watercraft), nor to a specific kind of vehicle (submarines) but to a specific vehicle the character uses (Red October).

Jump Intuition
Prerequisite: Pilot 1
The character has a natural – or perhaps supernatural – knack for navigating Jump Space. Roll with Advantage when making a Jump throw.
Ace
Prerequisite: Relevant Vehicle Skill 1, or Pilot 1
The character is a gifted expert at maneuvering with a specific vehicle and can easily outmaneuver others to gain great advantage over them in combat. When throwing for a Position in a vehicle chase or battle using the vehicle skill the Ace trait applies to, throw with 2D and take the higher result. Note that an Ace in the Pilot skill would not be an Ace Driver, or Ace Grav Pilot. Each Vehicle skill and the Pilot skill has a separate Ace trait. Being an ace in multiple vehicles requires taking this trait multiple times. In starships (or other large, crewed vehicles) either the Pilot or Captain’s Ace trait may apply. In small craft, the Pilot must have the Ace trait to gain any benefit.

Mr. Fix-It
Prerequisite: Repair 1
The character is trained and experienced in performing fast and temporary repairs on vehicles. When throwing to attempt a jury-rig repair on a vehicle system, the mechanic throws with Advantage.

Easy Rider
Prerequisite: Animals 1
The character is well-trained in riding animals, Terran and alien beasts alike. When making a throw related to riding an animal, including when rolling for a Position in a chase, the rider throws 3D and picks the highest two.

Miracle Worker
Prerequisite: Engineering 1
The character is trained and experienced in performing fast and temporary repairs on starships. When throwing to attempt a Damage Control action, the mechanic throws 3D and picks the highest two.

Mask Engine
Prerequisite: Engineering 1
The engineer has developed techniques to make it more difficult to detect the ship. Roll Engineering 10+ and apply the Effect as a penalty for scanning vessels to detect this ship.

Point Defender
Prerequisite: Gunnery 1
The character is very skilled at destroying incoming missiles, and gains a +1DM to all rolls when engaging in the Point Defense Action—thus, the first point defense attempt would be at +1DM, the second at 0DM, the third at -1DM, etc.

Sensor Ace
Prerequisite: Computer 1
When using ship sensors to spoof missiles, jam enemy sensors, or to perform a scan for vessels, roll with Advantage.

Starship
Prerequisite: None.
The character has inherited, won by gambling, loaned, or otherwise received a share in a starship. You may take this Trait multiple times. The first time you take it, you receive a 200-ton Free Trader, a 100-ton mining vessel, a 100-ton Scout or a 200-ton Research Vessel, with forty years’ worth of full mortgage payments remaining. Each additional time you take this Trait, increase the ship's age by a decade and reduce the mortgage payments by one decade as well. Taking this Trait five times means owning a ship outright, but it will be a 40-year-old antique. If the character already has the Starship trait, and musters out with a Trader, Scout, or Research vessel, count that Mustering Out Benefit as if they had taken the Starship trait again. For example, a Scout picks the Starship trait, and then receives two Scout Mustering Out Benefits. Instead of having a Scout on loan from the Scout Service, the character owns a 20-year-old Scout starship with 20 years of the mortgage already paid off.
Stunt Driver
Prerequisite: Relevant Vehicle Skill 1
The character has a flair for handling vehicles in situations that were well outside the engineering team’s parameters when the vehicle was in the design and testing phase. Whenever the character is performing stunts like flying aircraft into tunnels, driving motorcycles down flights of stairs, or even jumping cars off ramps and over ravines, throw the relevant vehicle skill with Advantage.
