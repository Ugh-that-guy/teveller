Appendix - Aliens
Grand interstellar drama often calls for sentient aliens. Unlike the unfathomable alien life of a hard-science universe, the following three species follow common space-opera tropes. They are humanoid, reminiscent of Terran animals, and in one case – inspired by pop-culture UFO lore. These aliens are close enough to humans to be playable without much work.
Under these rules, aliens use the same careers as humans do, but have alien traits that set them apart from humanity.
For more detailed alien species and cultures, as well as advanced alien character generation, we recommend our grand space-opera setting: These Stars Are Ours! available from Stellagama Publishing in PDF and print-on-demand formats.

Grays
Short in stature but intellectually powerful, the gray aliens are a staple of science fiction and popular culture. Common lore has them flying in saucers and abducting people for horrific scientific experimentation. All grays are biologically female. They reproduce asexually, each daughter being a clone of her mother with minimal variation. Curiosity drives the grays and they value rationality; they are excellent scientists and strategists. They are, however, poor fighters, and prefer to use technology and the slave races they have subjugated to fight their battles.
Grays have the following traits:
•	Injured or sick grays require a medical facility (or tools) of TL10 or better, otherwise they suffer DM-2 to any related medical throws.
•	Grays do not need to acclimatize to low-gravity environments.
•	At character generation, grays roll 1D for STR and 1D for END, but 3D for DEX and INT.


Reptiloids
These warm-blooded reptile-like aliens bring the might of the monitor lizard and the agility of the gecko to the stars. Males are taller and stronger than humans, while females are human-sized. Civilization transformed the male reptiloid’s murderous territorial instincts into a less destructive, but always present, competitive streak. A male reptiloid lives and dies for glory - constantly proving his mettle to his peers and vying for higher spots in his social pecking order. Females, on the other hand, consider the big picture issues important to reptiloid tribal society: government, commerce, and technical development. The males, and to a lesser degree the females, are excellent warriors, though many try their hand in commerce (and piracy!) as well.
Reptiloids have the following traits:
•	See twice as far as humans in low-light conditions.
•	DM+2 to all Athletics throws to climb. May cling to walls and ceilings on a successful throw of Athletics 8+ per round of clinging.
•	Reptiloids do no suffer hourly damage from hot weather exposure up to 50°C.
•	Males enjoy a +1 bonus to STR and a penalty of -2 to INT; females enjoy a +1 bonus to EDU and a penalty of -2 to STR. This cannot bring INT or STR to less than 1.

Insectoids
The Insectoids were once the pests living in the detritus of another more advanced civilization. But that civilization fell, and the Insectoids soon thrived in their precursors’ ruins. Opportunistic and hardy, these bug-folk quickly learned how to bring their world’s old masters’ technology back to life. This has enabled them to skip many millennia of cultural evolution. They are expert tinkers, peddlers of trinkets, and boundless opportunists. Terrans may deride them as space cockroaches, but still enjoy their trade and diplomatic neutrality, nonetheless.
Insectoids have the following traits:
•	Fast-growing. Start their career at the age of 10 and start aging after their third term, at the age of 22. May use career tables for up to 5 terms.
•	2 points of natural armor. Non-cumulative with worn armor heavier than Jack.
•	Insectoids do not need to acclimatize to low-gravity environments.
•	-2 penalty to EDU. This cannot bring EDU to less than 1.
•	DM+2 to any throw to avoid poison or disease; DM+2 to any throw to cure an insectoid from a poison or a disease.
•	As an action, an insectoid may throw Athletics 6+ to jump 6m in any direction.
