Character Generation
Your character starts the game as a skilled, experienced adult. This chapter will show you how to generate a character and take them through a career.

Step 1: Characteristics
Characteristics describe your character’s general talents and abilities. They serve as basic skills – for tasks which every human (or alien!) can perform, but some can perform better or worse than others. They also modify your character’s skill throws, representing your natural aptitude with various tasks.
Assign the following array to the six characteristics in any order desired to your six characteristics: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
The characteristics are:
Strength (STR): Physical prowess and brute force.
•	Strength determines a character’s carrying capacity.
•	Add your STR DM to your melee damage. Note, however, that even with low STR, any attack that hits does at least 1 point of damage (before armor).
•	Strength modifies skill throws related to brute force and feats of raw might.
Dexterity (DEX): Agility, coordination, and speed.
•	Dexterity is the attribute used for throwing knives and grenades, as well as evading physical threats.
•	Add your DEX DM to your ranged attack throws.
•	Dexterity modifies skill throws related to coordination and speed.
Endurance (END): Physical resilience, fitness, and force of will.
•	Endurance helps the character resist biological threats such as disease and poison.
•	Endurance determines your character’s Stamina and Lifeblood, representing toughness and resistance to damage, respectively (see below).
•	Endurance modifies skill throws related to physical resilience.
Intelligence (INT): Reasoning, creativity, and intellectual capabilities.
•	Together with EDU, Intelligence determines the character’s maximum number of skill ranks.
•	Intelligence modifies skill throws related to reasoning, creativity, and perceptiveness.
Education (EDU): Formal schooling and general knowledge.
•	Education 8+ allows rolling on the Advanced Education column in the career tables.
•	A character gains a number of additional languages equal to their EDU DM.
•	Together with INT, Education determines the character’s maximum number of skill ranks.
•	Education modifies skill throws related to academics, science, and knowledge.
Social Standing (SOC): A character’s connections and position in society.
•	Social Standing provides characters with a number of free contacts equal to their SOC DM.
•	Social Standing often modifies skill throws in social settings.


Characteristic DMs
Each characteristic has an associated Dice Modifier (DM) based on its value or score, as noted below:

Characteristic DMs
Characteristic Score	Characteristic DM
0-2	DM-2
3-5	DM-1
6-8	DM+0
9-11	DM+1
12-14	DM+2
15-17	DM+3
18-20	DM+4

Above 20, a character increases their characteristic DM by another +1 per three points – for example, 21-23 will have DM+5, and so on. This means that very powerful creatures will almost automatically succeed in throws using their powerful characteristic. This is intentional: a massive alien brute, for example, would be capable of feats of strength unattainable by most humans.

Using characteristic throws
Characteristics represent general human (or alien!) capabilities that every character possesses to one degree or another. This is opposed to skills, which represent specialized training. These include things such as fitness and agility (STR, END, and DEX), general reasoning (INT), general knowledge (EDU), and using connections and social innuendo to further one's ends (SOC). Anyone can jump to a certain distance (DEX), but not everyone can pilot a starship (Piloting skill). However, general aptitudes do influence even the actions of professionals, for example the DEX DM is often added to Piloting skill throws.
Characteristic throws use only the Characteristic DM, rather than Characteristic + Skill. Characteristic throws do not suffer the DM-3 Unskilled penalty. Characters never suffer the DM-3 Unskilled penalty for Athletics throws.
Example: A character with EDU 5 tries to recall a fun piece of trivia. The Referee calls for an EDU characteristic roll. The roll is 2d6, DM-1.

Step 2: Homeworld Skills
At the age of 18, before embarking in a career, your character has already learned a single skill. Choose a homeworld type and one skill from its list.

Homeworld	Available Skills (choose one)
High-tech core world	Computer-1, Grav Vehicles-1, Streetwise-1
Water World	Watercraft-1, Repair-1, Athletics-1
Capital World	Carousing-1, Grav Vehicle-1, Liaison-1
Frontier colony	Driving-1, Watercraft-1, Survival-1
Inhospitable outpost	Repair-1, Science-1, Zero-G-1
Primitive backwater	Animals-1, Recon-1, Survival-1

Step 3: Career
Characters start off at the age of 18. Then they “grow” through the character generation system.
Note that the total sum of a character’s skill Levels can never exceed the sum of their INT + EDU characteristics. However, first generate the character and list all skills, even if they exceed this limit. After Mustering Out, if the total of your skill points exceeds the sum of your INT + EDU, you may choose which skills to reduce to bring your total under the character’s INT + EDU. You may reduce skills to Level Zero, as they do not count against the character’s skill level total.
The Referee determines the number of career Terms characters will go through prior to the game’s start. Each Term represents roughly 4 years.

A.	Term 1: Select a career. Your character begins their career at Rank 0.
1.	Note your career’s Service Skills. You can raise one Service Skill to level-1.  The rest of the Service Skills are Level 0.
2.	Pick TWO skill levels from that career’s available skills tables: Service, Specialist, or Advanced Education.
i.	Characters must have an EDU 8+ to select from the Advanced Education table.
ii.	A maximum of ONE skill level per term may be spent to improve any Characteristic by +1.
iii.	No skill level may be higher than 2 in the first term.
iv.	Roll on the Career’s Event Table. This might increase the number of skills the character receives, or even cause injury. Note that if an event calls for a skill test, do not include any Attribute DMs. Just throw 2D and add the skill level, if any. If the character does not have the listed skill, do not apply any penalty.
3.	Increase the character’s age by 4 years to 22 years old.
i.	OPTION: Roll 1D for the number of years the character ages this term.

B.	Second and Subsequent Terms: Select skill levels from available tables.
1.	As characters advance their careers, the number of skill levels available per term decreases. See the Master Character Generation Table, below.
2.	A maximum of one skill level per term may be spent to improve any characteristic by +1.
3.	Increase career Rank by 1 on terms 2, 4, and 6. Add additional Bonus Rank skills as indicated on the Rank Table.
4.	Roll on the Career’s Event Table.
5.	Increase the character’s age by 4 years.
i.	OPTION: Roll 1d6 for the term length in years.
6.	Roll for Aging Effects at the end of Term 4 and subsequent Terms. Note that even if the character is not yet 34 years old, begin rolling for aging effects at the end of Term 4.

C.	Mustering Out:
1.	Roll for Mustering Out Benefits on the relevant career table. The number of Mustering Out Benefits is equal to 1, plus 1 per term served. The player may choose to roll on the Cash Benefits or Material Benefits table for each roll.
2.	Rank as Mustering Out Benefit: you may purchase additional Rank levels with a Mustering Out Benefit. Each promotion costs one Mustering Out Benefit. Gain any Rank skills at appropriate ranks.
3.	OPTION: The Referee may assign additional level-0 skills (see the Skills chapter).
4.	OPTION: The Referee may wish that each character have a skill from a given Skill Package (see below) in addition to their career skills. Select one skill from the indicated Skill Package at this time. Each skill from a Package may only be selected once, by one character.
5.	Select 1 Trait from the Traits chapter for every 2 terms served, rounding up (see Master Character Generation Table, below).
 

Skill Packages
Campaign Style	Skills Available
Exploration	Piloting-1, Engineering-1, Survival-1, Science-1, Repair-1
Military	Leadership-1, Gunnery-1, Melee Combat-1, Heavy Weapons-1, Tactics-1
Naval	Piloting-1, Computer-1, Repair-1, Gunnery-1, Engineering-1
Trading	Piloting-1, Engineering-1, Liaison-1, Medicine-1, Steward-1
Criminal	Streetwise-1, Stealth-1, Admin-1, Recon-1, Deception-1

Master Character Generation Table
Terms	Skill Levels Granted	Total Skill Levels*	Aging?	Rank Increase?	Traits	Mustering Out Benefit Rolls	Total Events
0	1 (homeworld)	1	N		1	1	0
1	2, plus a level 1 service skill	4	N		1	2	1
2	2	6	N	+1	1	3	2
3	2	8	N		2	4	3
4	1	9	Y	+1	2	5	4
5	1	10	Y		3	6	5
6	1	11	Y	+1	3	7	6
7	1	12	Y		4	8	7
* As noted above, regardless of homeworlds, careers, and packages, the total number of skill tanks a character may possess may not exceed the sum of their INT and EDU Characteristics.

Optional Rule: Switching Careers
Some Referees allow characters to switch careers during character generation. This is simple enough. Simply switch careers. The character begins at Rank 0, unless they are in a military career and switching into another military career—in that case, keep the character’s rank the same (though you should convert Army ranks to equivalent Navy or Marine ranks).
Characters in their new career receive ONE Service Skill at Level-0, and then proceed normally in their new career, using the Master Character Generation Table to determine how many skill levels they may pick in their new profession. Mustering Out Benefits are rolled on the appropriate career table. Reduce the total number of Benefit rolls by one for each career change to reflect the hardships that starting a new career often entail.

Stage 4: Calculate Stamina and Lifeblood
The character’s Stamina represents their toughness, and their ability to take a hit and shrug it off. Stamina is equal to the sum of character’s END Characteristic + Athletics skill. For example, a character with END 7 and Athletics 1 will have Stamina 8.
The character’s Lifeblood represents their resistance to injury. It is equal to twice the sum of the character’s END Characteristic and Athletics skill. For example, a character with END 7 and Athletics 1 will have Lifeblood 16.
If the character lacks the Athletics skill, their Stamina simply equals their END score, and their Lifeblood simply equals twice their END score.

Stage 5: Finalize the Character
Think of your characteristics character’s skills, career, and events. What kind of person are they? Why did they gain a level in Carouse when they should have focused on their careers and gained that level in Admin instead? What happened during their career that made them want to seek a life out in the stars? Perhaps look at the character’s career and create a narrative sketch of what their life was like. What does the character look like? How are they connected to the other Player Characters? Think of your character’s personality and motivation and give them a name.\
