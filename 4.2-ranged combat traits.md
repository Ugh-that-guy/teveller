Gun Combat Traits

Crack Shot
Prerequisite: Gun Combat 2, one other Gun Combat Trait
Pick one type of firearm category: semi-automatic pistols, revolvers, etc., and gain a +1D damage bonus when using them.

Defeat Armor
Prerequisite: Gun Combat 1
The character knows how to pick weak spots in the enemy's armor from a distance. When firing an aimed shot, if the to-hit throw's Effect is +6 or better, ignore the target's armor.

Gunslinger
Prerequisite: Gun Combat 2
The character is a master of handguns and can perform amazing feats of arms with them. When a shot fired by the character from a semiautomatic handgun "drops" an enemy (causes them to fall unconscious or die), the character may immediately attack a second enemy with the same handgun. The character can only attack one additional enemy per combat round. This is cumulative with the Double Tap weapon Aspect.

Rapid Reaction
Prerequisite: Gun Combat 1
The character has a quick finger on the trigger and reacts quickly to enemy movement. If an Overwatch shot fired by the character hits its target, the character remains in Overwatch and may react one more time in that round to enemy movement. This can be done only once per round (that is, up to two Overwatch shots per round). The Overwatch ends after the second attack.

Signature Weapon
Prerequisite: Gun Combat 1
The character is particularly proficient in using a specific weapon. Choose one specific weapon, such as your service revolver, the family hunting rifle, the laser pistol you pried from that alien’s cold, dead hands, etc.; when attacking with that specific weapon, the character gains a DM+1 to hit. You may choose this Trait multiple times, each applied to a different weapon. Note that this trait does not apply to a class of weapons (pistols), nor to a model of weapon (Colt .45s), but to a specific weapon the character owns (the custom pearl handled Colt .45 the character’s grandfather gave to him upon entering the Space Marines). If the weapon is lost or destroyed, you can adapt to a new weapon of the same type by training with it for a month. You can always have only one signature weapon at any given time.

Sniper
Prerequisite: Gun Combat 1
The character knows how to kill unsuspecting victims from a distance. When attacking an unaware target at range, using an aimed shot, add 1D to the attack's damage. This bonus can only be applied outside of active combat.

Spray N’ Pray
Prerequisite: Gun Combat 1
The character knows how to maximize the effect of automatic fire. When using an automatic weapon, treat its Auto rating as one point higher.
