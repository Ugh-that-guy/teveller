Starship Encounters
Space is indeed vast, however most travel between stars will happen in well-defined regions of solar systems: jump points, near gas giants, and near stations and smuggler caches. Thus, there are opportunities for random encounters. We present a simple set of rules to help GMs generate and develop space travel encounters for itinerant merchants, smugglers, pirates, and their ilk. These encounters can be used to spice up an adventure with something unexpected or can serve as the structure of the entire adventure, depending on the GM’s preference.
System Types
Each system has a traffic and safety level that determines how likely and how dangerous an encounter might be. Below are eight system types. We encourage GMs to come up with their own system types for their campaigns.
Middle of Nowhere: Nothing ever happens here, and why would it? This system is too far off the space lanes, or too poor, to attract much attention.
Bandit Territory: this backwater is home to pirate raiders and other criminals. Unfortunately, the system is not important enough to send a patrol ship to deal with the problem.
Going Concern: These prosperous systems are happy to engage in legal trade. There are regular naval patrols, and healthy levels of traffic.
Rail Head System: This system is either a free port, or on the frontier. Either way, there is a lot of economic opportunity here: trade is plentiful, as is crime.
Wild West System: There is little law and order in these busy systems, but enough valuable trade happens to make travelling here worthwhile, for the very enterprising, foolhardy, or desperate.
Capital: These systems are perfect examples of peace, security, and prosperity. Capital systems are usually the busiest in the sector and their space lanes are heavily patrolled. There is a lot of money to be made here, but most free-spirited traders will resent the high taxation that is the price for peace and prosperity.
Bazaar: Traders’ paradises, Bazaar worlds have everything to offer ambitious entrepreneurs. Nearly anything is available to be bought or sold in a Bazaar. There is just enough law and order here that pirates, and other criminals can’t operate openly.
Hive of Scum and Villainy: A free-for-all of corruption, iniquity, crime, and opportunity. Laws in these systems, when they are enforced, exist to maintain a thin veneer of civilization for the purposes of encouraging trade.
Encounter Generation Procedure:
1. Determine if there is an Encounter by rolling on the appropriate System column of the Encounter Table.
2. Determine the Encounter Range.
3. Determine NPC Reaction Result
Ship Encounter Table
A (P) in the entry notes that this ship is willing and able to turn pirate should the PC vessel be an opportune target. The NPC Reaction Roll (below) should give the GM more guidance as to how to play an opportunistic pirate.

Ship Descriptions:
Encounters need not be limited to the ship types described below. GMs should feel free to develop their own encounter tables for their most often visited systems and substitute the appropriate ship types accordingly.
Ship Encountered	Description
Scout	Small ubiquitous ships transporting information or something more tangible.
Salvage/Miner	Common system ships that locate raw or recyclable materials and extract them. Grimy and unglamorous.
Research	Advanced ships with high tech toys, staffed with bored crew and science nerds.
Yacht	A plaything for the very wealthy. Usually unarmed and filled with luxuries. Some are very advanced.
Liner	Large ships designed to haul large numbers of passengers. Some are little more than glorified long-haul buses, while others are spectacularly opulent cruise ships.
Merchant	A class of ships encompassing free traders hopping from system to system, to large corporate freighters hauling bulk cargoes on the space lanes.
Patrol	Smaller military or police vessels that keep the peace and discourage piracy.
Warship	Dedicated combat vessels, including small battlegroups.
Pirate	This represents a full-blown pirate or privateering warship: a corsair or other heavy gunboat dedicated to piracy.

Encounter Frequency and Range
The GM should roll for encounters whenever the PCs enter a new system, or new region in a system. For example, when transiting from a mainworld to a system’s gas giant, roll when the ship arrives at the gas giant.
To determine the Encounter Range, the ship’s sensor operator should make a Computer/EDU 8+ roll, modified by ship’s sensor capabilities, the active or passive stealth capabilities of the encounter, the background radiation levels, and anything else the GM might want to include. Roll 1D and add the Effect of the roll. This is the number of hours at 1G thrust that it will take to intercept (or be intercepted by) the encounter, with a minimum of 6 minutes (one Space Combat Round).
Reaction Roll
The table below includes standard NPC Reactions on a 2d6 roll. As well, we have included some examples of likely attitudes and actions for each Reaction result to help as GM prompts. Remember to use common sense and interpret the NPC Reaction roll in the context of the specific encounter. The NPC Reaction roll should drive much of the initial interaction between the PCs and the encounter. GMs are encouraged to use the NPC Reaction Roll to differentiate between otherwise similar encounter results and keep the players guessing.

NPC Reaction Table (Roll 2D)
2D	Result	Attitude	Possible Actions
2	Hostile	The NPC will immediately attack (roll Morale), or actively spoil whatever plans the PCs have.	Attack, interfere, escape, flee. Whatever the PCs are doing, this NPC is against it. If the PCs are obviously more powerful, the NPC will leave.
3-5	Unfriendly	The NPC will do anything short of outright hostile action. They are unhelpful and untrustworthy.	Avoid, insult, lie, misdirect, mislead, waste time. The NPC is unwilling to resort to direct action.
6-8	Indifferent	The NPC is uninterested in helping or hindering the PCs.	Any socially acceptable neutral action. The NPC will act in a socially predictable or wary manner.
9-11	Friendly	The NPC is cooperative and friendly.	Chat, offer limited help, give information. The NPC will not act against the PCs.
12	Helpful	The NPC is interested in helping or cooperating with the PCs fully.	Aid, support. The NPC will join the PCs' cause with very little convincing.
