Skills
Characters in TevellerRPG use a variety of skills to confront the challenges awaiting them among the stars, from piloting a starship to shooting a laser.
Skills are a character’s greatest asset. Skilled characters are competent. A Skill at level 1 (denoted “Skill 1”) represents someone who is employable; Skill 3 denotes a trusted professional; and Skill 5 represents a world-class expert. For example, a newly trained paramedic has Medicine 1; an experienced physician has Medicine 3; and a cutting-edge cyber-surgeon, skilled beyond the typical physician, has Medicine 5. The task resolution system takes this into account – professionals should automatically succeed at routine tasks (difficulty 6+) and easily perform average tasks (difficulty 8+), while experts will automatically succeed in routine and average tasks and easily manage difficult (10+) ones.

A note about the Cepheus Engine Core and System Reference Document: TevellerRPG skills are somewhat different than those found in the Cepheus Engine Core rules but are easily compatible. Most notably, Repair is the combination of Electronics and Mechanics; Admin subsumes the Advocate skill; Carousing subsumes the Gambling skill.

Zero-Level Skills
Normally, a character is either skilled in a task or unskilled. In the latter case, they suffer DM-3 for lacking the appropriate skill. However, to facilitate play, we recommend that the Referee grant a few skills as “Zero-level” to each character at the start of the game. This means that while the character is not skilled enough to hold down a job with that skill, and does not enjoy a positive DM on rolls, the character is familiar enough with that skill to avoid the unskilled penalty (DM-3). The recommended Zero-level Skills for all adventurers are shown in the table below.

Skill List
The skills included below are comprehensive, though there can be overlaps between two or more skills, depending on the context of the skill use in question, the players, and the Referee. We advise a certain amount of flexibility to keep the game moving.
Admin: understanding and dealing with bureaucracies, businesses, and the law. Also covers forgery.
Aircraft: controlling and using atmospheric aircraft. This skill covers navigation and basic maintenance, but not repairing damage.
Animals: the care and training of animals. Also covers riding and general agriculture.
Athletics: the ability to exert oneself physically. You may add the Athletics skill to appropriate physical characteristic rolls. This skill is never rolled unskilled.
Carousing: the art of mingling in social settings to achieve your goals. Also covers gambling.
Computer: programming, working with computer hardware, and hacking. This skill also covers the use of sensors and communications gear.
Deception: convincingly avoiding the truth and misleading other people. This skill covers sleight-of-hand and disguise as well.
Demolitions: working with explosives to blow stuff up! This skill also covers defusing said explosives before they blow up!
Driving: controlling and using ground vehicles. This skill covers navigation, as well as basic maintenance, but not repairing damage.
Engineering: using and maintaining of starship drives, powerplants, and other systems specific to starships. Engineering is the required skill for Jump drive operation. This skill is not a substitute for the Repair skill (below).
Grav Vehicles:  controlling and using gravitic vehicles. This skill also covers navigation and basic maintenance, but not repairing damage.
Gun Combat: using small arms, crossbows, and bows in combat.
Gunnery: using vehicle-mounted or spaceship-mounted weapons.
Heavy Weapons: using plasma guns, rocket launchers, and other portable heavy weapons.
Investigation: keen observation, forensics, research, and detailed analysis.
Jack o’ Trades: this special skill reduces the unskilled penalty (DM-3, noted above) by its level. For example, a character with Jack o’ Trades at level 2 would only suffer DM-1 to all unskilled rolls. You may not gain more than 3 levels in this skill and cannot improve it after character generation.
Leadership: motivating and directing others, often in times of crisis.
Liaison: negotiation and diplomacy in a myriad of social situations. This skill covers diplomatic meetings, haggling in interstellar trading negotiations, or at the shouq, and talking down a gunman who is holding hostages.
Medicine: training in the medical sciences, from diagnosis and triage to surgery.
Melee Combat: fighting hand-to-hand, either with a weapon or unarmed.
Piloting: operating, controlling, and navigating interplanetary and interstellar space craft, both in real space and in jump space.
Recon: scouting for danger and spotting threats, including traps. Recon also covers performing forward observation for artillery.
Repair: the ability to maintain, repair and build mechanical and electronic devices of all sorts. This skill also covers lockpicking, both mechanical and electronic. Ship-specific systems are handled by the Engineering skill, and Computers covers the use of electronic devices.
Science: the multi-disciplinary scientific skill, as would be typical for a starship’s science officer.
Stealth: the ability to be unseen and unheard, both while stationary and moving.
Steward: the care and serving of passengers and other guests. Steward skill adds to the throw for locating High Passage passengers. See the Starship Operations chapter.
Streetwise: familiarity with underworld society and the ways of working with it. The Streetwise skill adds to the throw for finding Low Passage passengers (see the Starship Operations chapter for more details).
Survival: staying alive in the wilderness. This also covers “outdoor” skills such as tracking, foraging, navigation, and fishing.
Tactics: tactical planning and decision making, whether on the ground or in space.
Watercraft:  controlling and using watercraft, including submarines. This skill includes navigating these vehicles, as well as performing basic maintenance, but not repairs.
Zero-G: working and living under microgravity conditions. Also covers the use of space suits and heavy armor. When characters are in combat in microgravity, they should use the lower of their combat or Zero-G skill.

Languages
Characters know a number of languages, in addition to their cultures' standard language, equal to their EDU modifier (see Characteristic Modifiers in Chapter 4: Character Generation). After character generation, characters may learn additional languages using the experience rules (see below) by purchasing the language for 8 XP. There are no skill levels of a language; either a character knows that language or they do not. The Referee is free to allow a Level 0 version of a language skill, representing a basic understanding of the language.

A note on Prospecting
Uranium Fever, a belter sourcebook by Stellagama Publishing, uses the Prospecting and Comms skills for asteroid mining. When using TevellerRPG with that book, use the Science skill instead of Prospecting and Computer instead of Comms.

Skill Advancement
TevellerRPG characters can slowly advance in skill through experience. Players advance their characters by spending Experience Points (XP). A Character will typically gain 1 XP per session. The Referee might award 2 XP for a session where the player did an outstanding job, or if the character was very successful. Characters can only advance skills during downtime in game: during periods of relative quiet and inactivity. Note that advancement is incremental: for example, to increase a skill from Level 1 to Level 3, the character must first purchase Level 2 and only then Level 3. In general, use of XP should allow a character to increase one skill by one level per game year.
Increasing Skills
Spend XP to increase skills per the following table. Skills can be improved by exercise or study, represented by spending XP, as noted in the table below.
 

Desired Skill Level	XP Cost
0	2
1	10
2	20
3	20
4	30
5	40

Note, however, that the total sum of a character’s skill levels still may not exceed the sum of their current INT + EDU characteristics. If using Level 0 skills, these do not count towards the maximum skill levels.

Learning Languages
You may learn a new language by investing 8 XP.

Gaining Traits
You may gain a new Trait by investing 30 XP. The character must meet all the prerequisites to purchase the Trait.

Optional Rule: Improving Characteristics
Some Referees may allow characters in their games to improve their characteristics. If this is the case, then any characteristic may be increased via XP expenditure, except for Social Standing.
To improve a characteristic by one point, spend XP equal to three times the new value. So, to improve a characteristic from 7 to 8 costs 24XP. The human maximum for any characteristic is 15, and Referees may wish to limit the number of times a given characteristic may be improved to 2 or 3. Social standing can only be improved by social advancement, which is accomplished through role-playing and successful adventuring.
