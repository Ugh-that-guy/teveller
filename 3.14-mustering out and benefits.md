Mustering Out Benefits
Characters may gain cash or material benefits from Mustering Out. Roll on the Material or Cash Benefit tables on the appropriate career table.
Cash benefits can be spent on equipment, weaponry, trade goods for speculative trade, or saved for later. Characters with the Carouse skill may throw Carouse/SOC 10+ to gain a DM+1 on a given Cash Benefit Table roll. If they fail, they get a DM-1 to the roll instead. Penalties or bonuses to the Mustering Out Benefit rolls can never raise the result over 6 or lower it below 1.

Characters may gain one or more of the following material benefits:
•	Contact: gain an important and useful relationship with a person or group who can provide you with significant favors: an arms dealer might provide otherwise unobtainable gear, while a corporate exec could serve as a patron and supply highly useful information on the corporate world. Contacts typically stay on one world, but some do move around. Abusing contacts and not reciprocating the positive relationship can lead to the loss of the contact. Note that characters with a positive SOC DM gain a number of free contacts equal to that DM.
•	Corsair: gain a 300-ton pirate Corsair. The ship belongs to a pirate boss or gang; you owe them big time for the use of the ship, and they will request favors from time to time. You pay for all regular operating costs and owe half the profits from your piracy to the boss or gang.
•	Free trader: gain a 200-ton Free Trader ship. The character must make mortgage payments of Cr230,000 a month for the next forty years. Each additional time you receive this benefit reduces this by ten years; receive it four times, and you don’t have to pay a mortgage; but you get a 40-year-old antique!
•	Explorer’s Society: Become a member of the exclusive Explorer’s Society. Membership grants a free high-passage ticket for one parsec every two months and free stay at Society hostels in most starports.
•	Passage: Gain a single ticket of the type named (low, middle, high) for travelling one jump (up to two parsecs) on a starship.
•	Prospector: Gain partial ownership in a 100-ton Prospector – typically subsidized by the government or handed down due to military or commercial arrangements. You must pay operating expenses and maintenance. You don’t owe any payments for the ship, but it is a 1D decades old rustbucket – beware!
•	Research Vessel: gain a 200-ton Research Vessel. The ship belongs to a research institute and the character pays for regular operating expenses, except for annual maintenance. The research institute has a right to veto certain activities and missions that the character might undertake—often, the research institute will insist on an NPC minder to be part of the crew. The institute’s leadership may also require that the scholar undertake missions for them from time to time.
•	Scout Ship: gain a 100-ton Scout Ship. The Scout Service still owns the ship but makes it available to you on reserve basis. You gain free maintenance and refueling for the vessel at Scout bases. Expect the Scout Service to have missions for you from time to time.
•	Weapon: Gain any non-heavy personal weapon or weapons up to TL12 (the Referee might change the TL for their game). The weapon or weapons may be worth up to Cr1,000 in value including ammunition. Multiple benefits of this kind allow either multiple weapons or a more expensive weapon. Weapon modifications are included in this budget as well.
Alternatively, the character may opt to take personal armor, or, at the Referee's discretion, cybernetics, under the same restrictions, customized as desired by the character under the given budget
•	Space Suit: the character receives a standard issue space suit. Multiple benefits of this kind allow the character to upgrade to a Hostile Environment Space Suit, or an Advanced Space Suit, their choice.
•	Yacht: gain the use of a 100-ton yacht from a government or corporation. You are responsible for all costs and maintenance and owe favors to said government or corporation. They will call in those favors in from time to time.
Retirement Pay
Characters who retire after 5 terms (age 38) or more receive an annual retirement pay. The base pay at 5 terms is Cr10000 a year; each additional term served in that career adds Cr2000 per year.
