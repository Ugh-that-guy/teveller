Psionics
Many science fiction genres posit that in the future, humanity may unlock the powers of the mind, allowing humans to reliably produce tangible psychic effects. Note that in TevellerRPG, psionics are rare and potentially very powerful. Their use in a campaign is subject to the Referee’s discretion.

Psionic Training
The Referee may decide to allow one or more psionic characters. In that case, roll 2D to determine the character’s Psionic Strength (PSI) characteristic. The character may gain one of the following psionic talents. They may also attempt to gain further psionic talents. For each additional psionic talent, throw PSI 8+ to receive that talent. Apply a DM-1 per talent the character already has. The five psionic talents are:
•	Awareness – powers that allow the psion’s mind to control their own body.
•	Clairvoyance – these powers permit perception at a distance.
•	Telekinesis – the psion is able to control the movement of matter with their mind.
•	Telepathy – this talent covers reading minds and mental communication.
•	Teleportation – the psion can move from one point to another instantly in open defiance of the laws of physics.

Optional Rule: Powerful Psions
For a more predictable distribution of Psionic Strength, the Referee may permit psionic characters to roll 1D+6 for their PSI rather than 2D. This will ensure that all psionic characters are reasonably competent but will also somewhat increase their power level.

Using a Psionic Talent
To activate a psionic talent, the psion must spend the listed number of PSI points, which are taken directly from the PSI characteristic. If this activation cost reduces their PSI below zero, then apply the excess points to the psion’s Stamina, and then Lifeblood scores, as damage. A character with no PSI points remaining cannot activate a talent. Using a psionic talent in combat counts as an action. Each Talent’s various abilities note the minimum PSI characteristic required for its use. This is also the cost in PSI points to use the ability. It also notes the ability’s range. Characters regain their full PSI points after an 8-hour rest.

Awareness
Awareness allows the psion greater control over their own body.
Enhanced Characteristic (PSI 1+, Personal): the character may transfer PSI points to their STR, END, or DEX as desired. This ability costs 1 PSI point per characteristic point added and lasts for 10 minutes. Multiple simultaneous uses of this ability are permitted, as long as the psion has sufficient PSI to spend. Characteristic increases will change that Characteristic’s DM, accordingly.
Suspended Animation (PSI 3, Personal): the character enters a meditative state for 7 continuous days without requiring food, water, or a breathable atmosphere; the character is immune to vacuum for this power’s duration. The psion may terminate this power at will during this period.
Magnify Senses (PSI 4, Personal): choose one sense; the psion magnifies it to a superhuman level for 10 minutes. Magnifying sight removes the penalty for firing a weapon beyond its effective range. Magnifying hearing grants DM+2 to Surprise throws. Magnifying smell grants the character with the olfactory senses of a bloodhound. Magnifying taste permits the character to detect toxins in minute samples of substance. Magnifying touch permits detecting microscopic features in the touched surface, such as microscopic cracks.
Awakening (PSI 5, Personal): the psion can awaken any single unconscious character. While this power does not heal any damage, it can awaken unconscious wounded characters, and safely thaw cryogenically frozen persons (without requiring a low tech cryotube’s survival throw). The awakening process takes one round.
Alter Self (PSI 6, Personal): the psion can change their appearance, including their fingerprints and other biometric markers, as desired, within the limits of their species or similar subspecies (including choosing a different gender). If the psion studies a target for 10 minutes (even covertly), they can imitate this target and its biometric markers. The disguise lasts for 8 hours.
Regeneration (PSI 9 but see below for cost; Personal): the psion can heal their own Lifeblood points lost from combat damage. This requires 2 PSI point per Lifeblood point healed but requires a minimum of PSI 9 to use. The effects of the healing take one combat round: a character who is uses Regeneration in one round will not feel the effects until the start of the next round.
Drain Health (PSI 10 but see below for cost; Personal): drain 1 Lifeblood from a target, per PSI point spent, healing the psion at the same rate, up to their full Lifeblood rating. If the psion is uninjured, the target still takes damage. Note that touching an unwilling target requires an attack throw, using the psion’s Melee Combat skill and Psi DM.
Empathic Healing (PSI 12 but see below for cost; Personal): this ability allows the psion to heal others. For every two PSI point spent, the psion can heal a target for one point of Lifeblood. The psion suffers 1d6 damage every time they use this power. Targets cannot regain more points than their maximum Lifeblood.

Clairvoyance
Clairvoyance abilities allow the psion to sense events at distant locations beyond out of view. Clairvoyance cannot usually be blocked.
Sense (PSI 1, 50m): the character learns the rudimentary goings-on at a nearby location when using this ability. This provides the psion with a basic understanding of who and what is in a location, and generally what they seem to be doing, rather than any great details.
Clairvoyance/Clairaudience (PSI 5, 500km): this ability allows the character to view (clairvoyance) or to hear (clairaudience) a specific location up to 500km away. The character perceives the location as if they were actually there.
Danger Sense (PSI 6, 30m radius): a precognitive power, danger sense grants the psion with the ability to sense potential threats. For 8 hours per use of this power, the Referee will inform the character about any serious active threat to their lives, such as an ambush or surprise attack. This grants DM+2 to Surprise rolls as well.
Clairsentience (PSI 7, 500km): the psion can use this ability to use all senses to perceive a location up to 500km away. The character perceives the location as if they were actually there.

Telekinesis
Telekinesis allows the psion to manipulate objects without physically touching them.
Lift 1 gram (PSI 1, 50m): lift and maneuver up to a 1gm object for 1 minute (10 combat rounds). This power does not confer fine motor control to the telekinetic but is useful for moving small objects very subtly.
Lift 1kg (PSI 2, 50m): lift and maneuver up to a 1kg object for 1D combat rounds. The object can cause 1D damage if it is hurled at a target. To hit a target throw PSI 8+ using the psion’s full PSI characteristic, using the normal ranged combat modifiers.
Lift 100kg (PSI 5, 50m): lift and maneuver up to a 100kg object for 1D combat rounds. This will cause 3D damage if hurled at a target. To hit a target throw PSI 8+ using the psion’s full PSI characteristic, using the normal ranged combat modifiers. Psions can also lift themselves or one other person if they are 100kg or lighter. This rudimentary flying can move a character at 5m per round, for one minute.
Choke (PSI 8, 10m): grab a single humanoid by its throat, or equivalent, at a distance, and suffocate them for 1D damage per round, for a maximum number of rounds equal to the psion’s full PSI score. The target may throw STR 10+ to break this chokehold; one attempt is permitted per combat round.
Dissipate Energy (PSI 9, Personal): throw 5D. This is the number of damage points, from any source, that the power absorbs without harming the character. Once these points are expended, the power ends.
Microkinesis (PSI 10 but see below for cost, Personal): This ability allows the psion to manipulate microscopic objects. Microkinesis may be used for subtle, but highly effective attacks on internal organs, causing 1D damage per 2 PSI points spent. Alternatively, this power may aid Medicine (any Surgery or First Aid, but not Diagnosis), Engineering, or Repair rolls by DM+1 per 3 PSI points invested.
Zombie (PSI 11, 500m): this macabre power allows remote control of a relatively intact corpse as a puppet. The power lasts as long as the psion concentrates. The zombie can perform melee attacks in place of the psion’s actions. Corpses cannot be so finely controlled as to allow ranged attacks.


Telepathy
Telepathy is the terrifying talent of establishing mind-to-mind contact. It is usually subtle but can also be used to bluntly crush the wills of those who oppose the telepath.
Note that thoughts are universal, and thus psionic communications ignores language barriers. However, telepaths find it difficult to perform mental scans on, or communicate with species that are significantly different from themselves—such as an insectoid alien being mind-probed by a human telepath. Such psionic attempts incur double PSI costs.
Life Detection (PSI 1, 20m): the telepath can detect the presence of other minds, their general type (human, alien, animal, etc.), and their general location.
Telempathy (PSI 2, 20m): the telepath can read and communicate basic emotions; they may also attempt to influence the behavior of sentient beings and aliens, subject to Referee discretion.
Read Surface Thoughts (PSI 3, 20m): the telepath can read another sentient being’s active, current thoughts. A non-Psionic target cannot notice this power being used on them, but a Telepathic Shield (see below) blocks the attempt.
Invisibility (PSI 4, see below for range): this ability causes living creatures (but not machines) to ignore the telepath. The psion becomes invisible to all organic creatures within 10m range. It lasts while the psion concentrates on being invisible, which is a free action each round. Attacking any target terminates this power.
Communicate (PSI 5, 5km): the telepath communicate telepathically with one individual. The target does not have to be a telepath to receive and send thoughts in reply, but the telepath has to initiate the contact.
Emotion (PSI 6, 50m): this power forces one target to feel a powerful emotion (such as fear) for 1D combat rounds.
Suggestion (PSI 7, 5km): the telepath can plant a simple hypnotic suggestion in the target. Note that targets will not obey suggestions that may physically harm themselves. Furthermore, if the suggestion would cause the target to harm a friend, they may throw INT 6+ to resist the effect.
Memory Block (PSI 8, Personal): this insidious ability causes one target to forget up to 12 hours of their recent memory. A Probe (see below) circumvents the Block.
Probe (PSI 9, 1m): Telepaths can use this ability to read deeply into the thoughts and long-term memories of a target. The Probe allows the character to know everything the target knows about one specific topic before terminating.
Assault (PSI 10, 250m): a brute-force telepathic assault, causing 4D damage to the target. Apply damage first to the target’s PSI, then their Stamina, and finally their Lifeblood. If all three characteristics are reduced to zero, the target dies from a brain hemorrhage. Damage from a telepathic assault regenerates as per the regular healing rules.
Domination (PSI 12, 5km): the telepath can mind-control one target for 2D combat rounds. The control is so complete that it may include forcing the target into harming their friends. If the telepath commands the dominated target to harm themselves, they may throw INT 8+ to shake off the mind control.
Shields and Telepathic Combat: all telepaths can shield themselves and allies in a 3m radius from telepathic intrusion. Attempting to use a telepathic ability against a shielded target requires an opposed PSI throw. Telepathic defenders shielding their allies throw for non-psionic allies. The defender wins on a tie. If the intruder wins, they may use their ability as desired at the usual cost, and the defender loses one point of Psionic Strength. If the intruder loses, they fail to penetrate the shield and expend one point of Psionic Strength. Note that this uses both characters' current PSI DMs: an exhausted telepath is much more vulnerable to mental intrusion.
Teleportation
Teleportation allows instant travel between locations. The psion may only teleport their body, clothes, and personal equipment. Characters cannot teleport more than one kilometer in altitude in a gravity well: teleportation still obeys the law of conservation of mass and energy and the difference in potential energy from any change in altitude must correspond to a change in body temperature in the teleporter. A change in altitude of more than one kilometer would heat or cool the teleporter’s body to a lethal degree. A single teleportation requires an action to perform.
Blink (1 PSI, 5m): allows for short teleports of 5m in any direction, while carrying up to a light encumbrance load.
Teleport Self (PSI 7, 5000km): the psion can teleport up to 5000km with light encumbrance load.
Heavy Teleport (PSI 11, 500km): like Teleport Self, but this ability allows the teleporter to carry up to a heavy encumbrance load, including carrying another living being.
Psionic Equipment
The following psionic equipment is available in settings using psionics.
Item	Tech Level	Cost
Psionic Booster	9	Cr500
Psionic Inhibitor	9	Cr4,000
Psionic Shield Helmet	8	Cr8,000
Psionic Shield	13	MCr1
Psionic Booster: this esoteric drug restores up to 6 points of PSI. If ingested while the psion is at full PSI, it temporarily increases PSI by 4. Whenever taking more than one dose per week, throw END 6+ or suffer 3D damage and permanently lose one point of PSI.
Psionic Inhibitor: this drug forces the subject to make a PSI 9+ throw to use any psionic power and prevents PSI regeneration. This drug lasts for 4D hours, but the character can throw END 6+ each hour after the first four hours to shrug off its influence.
The Psionic Shield Helmet: fully protects its wearer from telepathic intrusion. However, a character wearing this helmet cannot use psionics themselves. This helmet does not protect its wearer from the effects of other psionic powers, such as telekinetic attacks.
Psionic Shield: as a psionic shield helmet, but cybernetically implanted and invisible to the casual observer.
