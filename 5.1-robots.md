Robots
Robots! The very word conjures up hopes and fears for the future. The idea of an autonomous mechanical entity is old, but its implementation became reality in the early 21st century CE on Earth (TLs7-8). At first, robots revolutionized industrial processes, but eventually even vacuum cleaners were roboticized. In these rules, contrary to various dictionary definitions, “robot” refers to a mobile, autonomous (or remote-controlled) machine capable of varied actions.
All robots and drones have a Chassis and a CPU. All robots (but not drones) have a Robot Type. It is possible to further modify robots, and we present a variety of options, but these modifications are not mandatory. Robots have a number of Build Points determined by their mass, limiting the totally number of components that can be installed. For the sake of rules simplicity and clarity, like organic beings, Robots have Stamina (superficial damage capacity) and Lifeblood (internal damage capacity). They also have armor that functions like personal armor to reduce the damage of attacks.
Note that robot base speed is 5m/action. Higher speeds require the installation of Modifications. Robots start with Sensors +0, further modified by Type and specific Modifications.

Robot design sequence
1.	Select a Chassis. This determines Mass, Stamina/Lifeblood, Build Points, and Armor.
2.	Select a CPU. Drones have no CPU; they always require a sentient operator. Smart drones and robots can operate autonomously. The CPU determines the robot’s Intelligence and skill points.
3.	For robots, select a Robot Type. This grants certain Modifications, two Base Skills, and could multiply the Chassis’ cost.
4.	In addition to Base Skills, robots with advanced CPUs have skill points to spend on skills. Use these skill points to improve Base Skills, or to purchase new ones. The maximum level in any skill depends on the CPU.
5.	Optional: purchase modifications, by spending Build Points.
