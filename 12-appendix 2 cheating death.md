Appendix - Cheating Death!

Death needs not be final! In advanced societies, technology permits, at a significant economic cost, to attempt and bring the dead back to life.

Cyborg Conversion
Beginning at TL9, advanced technology can repair even a dead body, replacing dead tissues with chromium and steel. Extremely invasive cybernetics can bring a dead or dying person back to life if their brain remains relatively intact and the body is not overly mangled. Only the best hospitals offer this treatment, typically requiring many physicians, nurses, and technicians to perform.
Cyborg conversion costs MCr6. As part of the conversion, any additional cybernetic implant may be installed at 75% of list price, since the massive cyber-surgery makes such installation easier. Note that dead bodies decompose with time and cyborg conversion cannot restore anyone who has been dead for over a month. However, a cryoberth can preserve a body indefinitely, so long as it remains functional. When performing cyborg conversion, the head surgeon makes a Medicine/INT 10+ throw. The result of the surgery depends on the Effect of this Medicine check, as shown on the table below.

Cyborg Conversion Results
Effect	Result
-6	The character cannot be revived even with advanced cybernetics and remains dead. Nothing further can bring the character back to life.
-5	The cyborg arises from the dead but is violently and irreparably insane due to faulty wiring and programming. The character awakens and attacks everyone next to them with murderous rage. The character cannot be subdued and later repaired. They must be terminated.
-2 to -4	The procedure fails. Further cyborg conversion or bio reconstruction attempts can be made, but at a DM-2 and double the cost. Negative DMs and cost multiplication are cumulative for repeated attempts, e.g., a third cyborg conversion attempt after failing twice will suffer DM-4 and will cost four times as much.
-1	The character returns to life with 1 point of Lifeblood! However, their body did not recover well from the cybernetic implantation process, which causes severe side effects. Roll 1D6: 1-2, the character loses their memory; 3-4, the character is only partially alive and suffers from cybernetic mismatch; 5-6, the character will occasionally suffer from sudden and unexpected fits of murderous rage. See below for descriptions of these states. Further surgeries and healing attempts follow the standard healing rules.
0	The character returns to life with 1 point of Lifeblood, though they still bear marks of their terrible injury. Roll 1D6: 1-2 the character suffers from partial memory loss; 3-4, the character will have severe recurring nightmares; 5-6, the character will undergo a profound personality change. Further surgery and healing follow the standard healing rules.
1 to 5	The character returns to life with 1 point of Lifeblood and will recover fully with proper medical care. However, they suffer moderate damage due to imperfect cyber-implantation. Roll 1D6: 1-2, the character will be sickly; 3-4, the character suffers physical characteristic loss; 5-6, the character suffers from shaking.  Further surgery and healing follow the standard healing rules.
6+	The character is lucky and awakens with full Lifeblood and Stamina and no perceptible side effects. No further healing required!

Cyborg Conversion Side Effects
Here is a list the effects of the various side effects caused by less-than-perfect cybernetic conversions.
Cybernetic Mismatch: The character is neither alive nor dead, and teeters constantly on death's door. They are kept alive only by cybernetics, whilst simultaneously suffering from cybernetic rejection. The character suffers DM-2 to all throws and only has half of their movement rate: in most cases, 5 meters per action. Every month, the character must roll END 8+ or die from cybernetic rejection.
Memory Loss, Full: The character suffers from complete amnesia, though they retain basic life skills and partial adventuring skills. Halve the character's EDU score, rounding down to a minimum of 1. Also, for each skill, throw INT 6+ or lose one level of the skill; a skill at level-0 reduced in such manner is lost.
Memory Loss, Partial: The character loses part of their memory but retains a general idea of their identity, as well as most skills. The character loses 1d3 points of EDU to a minimum of 1. Randomly choose one of the character’s skills that are at level-1 or higher: reduce it to level-0.
Personality Change: The character retains their memories. However, their personality has changed dramatically and profoundly. The player and Referee should negotiate this change. We suggest using some of the random NPC motivation tables found in the Social Encounters chapter to guide the process.
Physical Characteristic Loss: The character did not heal properly and now suffers from reduced abilities. Roll 1D: 1-2, the character loses 1d3 points of Strength; 3-4, the character loses 1D3 points of Dexterity; 5-6, the character loses 1d3 points of Endurance. The affected characteristic cannot be reduced below 1.
Recurring Nightmares: The character suffers from traumatic memories of their otherwise lethal injuries. They suffer from negative emotions and severe recurring nightmares every night. In addition to being wildly unpleasant, these nightmares prevent healthy sleep. The character suffers from severe insomnia, leading to constant Fatigue. At the Referee’s choice, this may be mitigated by stimulants – which, in turn, may be addictive.
Sickly: The character's body did not fully heal from the lethal trauma it suffered, as well as the cybernetic conversion. Their metabolism is now far weaker. Halve the character's Stamina score, rounding down to a minimum of 1. The character also suffers DM-2 to all rolls made to resist disease, poison, radiation, or any other biological effect.
Shaking: The character's cybernetic neural wiring and servos are not well-calibrated. They suffer from constant hand tremors, causing a DM-1 to skill and characteristic throws, as well as any other throws requiring steady hands.
Sudden Murderous Rage: The character awakens normally, but the cybernetic systems will develop critical and dangerous glitches. Whenever the Referee wishes, the character must throw INT 8+ or END 8+ (whichever is better) or fly into a murderous rage lasting 2D combat rounds, doing their best to kill any living or mechanical being in reach. After this violent break, they will return to normal and will not remember anything from their rage. We recommend that the possibility of a Sudden Murderous Rage might come up every week, or month, or whenever the character is under high stress situations, and something related to their trauma occurs. Referees are not encouraged to be particularly merciful…

Bio Reconstruction
At Tech Level 16, extremely advanced medical technology can perform miracles unimaginable by less advanced societies. By applying cutting-edge biotechnology, an advanced hospital or laboratory can grow back a dead body and restore it to full function. The only requirement for Bio Reconstruction is that the dead character's brain must be preserved in an intact enough state. This allows for the scanning of the brain’s neural pathways for imprinting in the new body. Bio Reconstruction is a monstrously expensive process, and it requires an advanced and full-scale hospital with access to the best scientific facilities and a large crew of experts in medicine and biology. Unlike cyborg conversion, however, this process is far less invasive and has a better chance of success.
The procedure costs MCr60 – as much as a small starship. In most cases, a patron of some sort will fund the procedure, usually in return to massive favors owed by the reborn subject. Note that dead bodies decompose with time and even this advanced method of bio reconstruction cannot restore a person dead for over a year; a cryotube can, however, preserve a body indefinitely. When performing the bio reconstruction, the head scientist makes a Medicine/EDU 10+ check. The result depends on the Effect of this Medicine check, as shown on the table below.

Bio Reconstruction Results
Effect	Result
-6	The attempt to revive the character failed, and no further attempts will succeed. The character is dead.
-5	The procedure fails. Further Bio Reconstruction attempts may be made, but at DM-2 and double the cost. Negative DMs and cost multiplication are cumulative for repeated attempts, e.g., a third Bio Reconstruction attempt after failing twice will suffer DM-4 and will cost four times as much.
-4 to -1	The character returns to life with 1 point of Lifeblood but suffers biological degradation. They will require 1D weeks of rest after emerging from the vat. Roll 1D: 1-4, the character loses their memory; 5, the character suffers from an incurable malignant illness; 6, the character will suffer from progressive dementia due to faulty brain reconstruction and imprinting. Further surgery and healing follow standard rules.
0	The character returns to life with 1 point of Lifeblood, though not perfectly so. Roll 1D: 1-2 the character suffers from partial memory loss; 3-4, the character's appearance changes radically; 5-6, the character undergoes a profound personality change. Further surgery and healing follow standard rules.
1 to 5	The character has been regenerated to 1 point of Lifeblood and will recover normally with medical care. Roll 1D for side effects: 1-2, the character suffers from a significant but non-debilitating disfigurement; 3-4, the character's appearance changes partially; 5-6, the character undergoes a physical characteristic change. Further surgery and healing follow standard rules.
6 or more	The character is lucky and awakens with full Lifeblood and Stamina, and no perceptible side effects.

Bio Reconstruction Side Effects
These are the various side effects and problems caused by partially successful Bio Reconstructions:
Appearance Change, Radical: The character looks like a completely new person and is unrecognizable by anything short of a genetic test. Even the fingerprints change. The exact details of this change are up to the Referee and player.
Appearance Change, Partial: The character looks similar to their old self, but not exactly so. People who know the character may attempt to recognize them on a successful INT 6+ throw. Other details and consequences of this change are up to the Referee and player.
Disfigurement: The character suffers a terrible disfigurement that no surgery may correct. It is not debilitating but is ghastly to look at and incurs DM-2 to any skill or characteristic throws related to diplomacy or persuasion. However, the character gains a DM+2 to any roll related to intimidation. The character is also easily recognizable.
Malignant Illness: Faulty genetic reconstruction causes a persistent, incurable malignancy in the character's body. Halve all physical Characteristics and round down to a minimum of 1. Furthermore, each month the character must throw END 8+ or die from the illness. Bio reconstruction, cyborg conversion, or any other procedure cannot restore a character who died in such a way. This is a good opportunity to tie up any loose ends from the character's previous life. They are living on borrowed time.
Memory Loss, Full: The character suffers from complete amnesia, though they retain basic life skills and partial adventuring skills. Halve the character's EDU score, rounding down to a minimum of 1. Also, for each skill, throw INT 6+ or lose one level of the skill; a skill at level-0 reduced in such manner is lost.
Memory Loss, Partial: The character loses part of their memory but retains a general idea of their identity, as well as most skills. The character loses 1d3 points of EDU to a minimum of 1. Randomly choose one of the character’s skills that are at level-1 or higher: reduce it to level-0.
Personality Change: The character retains their memories. However, their personality has changed dramatically and profoundly. The player and Referee should negotiate this change. We suggest using some of the random NPC motivation tables found in the Social Encounters chapter to guide the process.
Physical Characteristic Change: The character's new body grows differently than the last one. Roll 2D three times and assign the values to the three physical characteristics, STR, DEX, and END, as desired.
Progressive Dementia:  The character's brain was not properly restored and will deteriorate with time. Each month, the character loses 1d3 points of INT and 1d3 points of EDU. When any of these characteristics reaches zero or below, the character falls into a vegetative state and will die within 1D months. If both fall below zero on the same month, the character suffers a stroke and dies immediately.
