Personal and Vehicle Combat
Spacers and adventurers often run into trouble among the stars. Hopefully, they’ll be able to talk and negotiate their way out of problems. However, in many cases they will have to fight, be that for a cause, goal, or for survival. The following rules allow quick resolution of combats.
See the weapon descriptions in the Equipment chapter for various special Weapon Aspects and how to use them with these rules.

Combat Procedure Outline
1.	Check for surprise. If one party surprises the other, they gain one free combat round during which the surprised party cannot act.
2.	Determine Initiative for all combatants.
3.	Start the combat round.
3.1.	Combatants act in Initiative order (highest first).
3.2.	On their turn, each character has two actions. They may use them for attacks, movement, and other actions. Apply any damage inflicted by an attack immediately.
3.3.	Once the combat round is over, begin a new round, until the battle is over.
4.	If necessary – triage and treat the wounded.

Combat Rounds
Combat takes place in 6-second segments called Combat Rounds. Characters act in descending initiative order, as discussed below, in each combat round – unless they are surprised or otherwise unable to act.

Surprise
Characters may surprise other parties or be surprised by them. A good tactician or a keen-eyed recon specialist can lay a good ambush or avoid one.
In situations where surprise is possible, each party throws Recon/INT 10+ or Stealth/DEX 10+. If one party succeeds and the other fails, the winner gains surprise. If both sides succeed or both fail, there is no surprise. A party deliberately setting up an ambush gains DM+2 to surprise rolls: ambushes require advanced knowledge of an approaching enemy, which is beyond the scope of the combat rules. Groups in vehicles, or groups of eight or more characters, suffer DM-2 to surprise rolls. Note that the DM-3 unskilled penalty applies here; if no one in a party has the Recon or Stealth skills, the party throws 2D-3 (modified by the higher between their INT and DEX DMs) for surprise.
Surprise grants a free combat round during which the surprising party may act, but the surprised party may not.

Initiative
Once fighting begins, each combatant throws 2D + their Tactics skill (if any) + their INT DM. Record these rolls. In each combat round, characters act from the highest initiative score to the lowest. Note that the DM-3 unskilled penalty applies here; characters unskilled in Tactics throw 2D-3 + INT DM for initiative.
A character with Leadership may throw Leadership/INT 8+ at the beginning of combat; if successful, any characters in their parties may apply the throw’s Effect as a skill bonus to initiative. Combatants may only benefit once from this effect. If multiple characters with the Leadership skill are present, only the one with the highest Leadership skill may roll.

Optional Rule: Simultaneous Combat
As an alternative to initiative-based combat, some groups prefer simultaneous combat. First, resolve any surprise/ambush opportunities. In all subsequent combat rounds, use the following rules:
First resolve all melee attacks and movement; they all occur simultaneously and cause damage simultaneously. For example, a character who succeeded in a melee attack and was then incapacitated by another melee attack will still cause damage to their target. Actions are declared in reverse DEX order: the lower DEX combatants must declare their actions first. This gives a minor advantage to characters with faster reflexes.
Second, after resolving all melee attacks, movement, and damage, resolve all ranged attacks, their damage, and non-movement actions in the same manner.
Note that this makes combat more dangerous and less predictable. It also provides an intentional advantage to melee combat to make it worthwhile to develop and use in a battlefield dominated by guns – to allow for cutlass-wielding cyborg pirates and similar characters!

Actions and Attacks
Each character has two actions in their turn. Characters may use an action as follows:
Attack: attack as described below.
Charge: run to a single enemy at a range of up to 20m and make a melee attack at DM+2. Characters on Overwatch (see below) being charged at can, of course, react and attack the charging enemy. Characters not on Overwatch also gain a free attack against a charging enemy, but at DM-2.
Inspire: throw Leadership/INT 8+ to add DM+2 to any single character’s next throw.
Move: move up to 10m. Alternatively, fall prone or get up from a prone position.
Overwatch: delay your action until an enemy moves through your line of sight or attacks you. When this happens, you may immediately act, regardless of initiative order. You may hold your Overwatch for a number of rounds equal to your END score.
Other Typical Actions include it is impossible to list all potential character actions. Instead, here are a few that can serve as guidelines to assist Referees in determining whether or not whatever the player wants to do is an action or would require more or less time.

Drawing and readying a weapon
Loading a weapon
Forcing open a locked door
Operating sensors
	Calling an artillery strike
Trying to bypass a lock to open a bulkhead door
Piloting a vehicle through difficult terrain
Performing a stunt in a vehicle

Melee Attacks
To hit in melee (hand-to-hand combat), throw Melee Combat/STR 8+. You may not attack in melee with a longarm (such as a rifle) unless you use it as a cudgel (2D damage) or as a spear (3D damage with a bayonet). You may attack with a handgun (including shotguns and submachineguns) in melee at DM-2 to hit. Note that if a shield is used with the Overwatch action in combat, the wielder is treated as having partial cover, as noted below. This gives an enemy DM-2 to hit the shielded character in melee.

Frenzy
A character with at least Melee Combat-1 who either kills or disables an enemy in melee combat may move 2m and immediately attack an adjacent enemy. Characters may do so in the same combat action for a number of times equal to their Melee Combat skill.

Ranged Combat
To hit a target in your weapon’s Effective range, throw Gun Combat/DEX or Heavy Weapons/DEX (as appropriate) 8+. Beyond Effective range, throw 10+ instead out to maximum range.
Hitting an obscured target (such as behind bushes) is penalized by DM-1; when attacking a target behind hard cover, the penalty is DM-2; and for heavy prepared cover, such as a bunker, attacks are penalized by DM-3.
Attacks on a prone character in ranged combat are penalized by DM-2; attacking a prone character behind cover uses that cover DM instead, with an additional DM-1.
However, if a character enjoys a total cover DM of -4 or more, they themselves cannot make any direct fire ranged attacks. They are completely blocked by their cover. They may still attack, and be attacked, by means of indirect weapons like grenades.
Shooting in darkness incurs DM-2 to hit, while shooting in dim light incurs DM-1 to hit. These penalties can be alleviated by various night vision devices.

Ranged Combat DM Table
Condition	DM
Target obscured (smoke, foliage)	DM-1
Target behind hard cover	DM-2
Target in heavy cover	DM-3
Target running (double move on its previous round)	DM-1
Target behind total cover	DM-4; direct fire impossible
Target prone	DM-2
Target prone behind cover	Cover DM and an additional DM-1
Darkness	DM-2
Dim Light	DM-1
Target dodging (optional rule)	DM-target's Gun Combat skill

Aiming
An aimed shot requires two consecutive actions and grants DM+1 to hit. A character may use their first action in a combat round to aim, then enjoy DM+1 to hit when firing on the second action. Alternatively, it is possible to begin aiming as the second action in one round and continue aiming through the first action of the next round, and then make an attack with the second action of that second round. The maximum +Dm achievable by aiming is +3.

Automatic Weapons
Automatic weapons fire multiple rounds with every pull of the trigger, filling the air with a hail of bullets. A weapon with the Auto aspect can make attacks in three fire modes: single, burst, and full auto, as described below.
Single: Attacks are made using the normal combat rules.
Burst: Add the Auto score to damage. This uses a number of rounds equal to the Auto score.
Full Auto: Make a number of attacks equal to the Auto score. These attacks can be made against separate targets so long as they are all within six meters of one another. Alternatively, use Full Auto for Suppression fire (see the Combat section). Full auto uses ammunition equal to three times the weapon’s Auto score. A weapon cannot use the Auto aspect with the Scope accessory or Aiming action. You may only perform one Full Auto attack in a given round.

Suppressive Fire
Instead of shooting a target, a character may fire an automatic weapon to deter enemy action in each area. Choose a 3m-by-3m area within effective range. Any combatants who move through this area, or caught in this area, suffer an automatic attack. However, do not apply the shooter's Gun Combat skill to this attack and apply a further DM-2 to it. Thus, such shots hit a suppressed target in Effective range on 10+, or 12+ while in cover – combatants under suppressive fire better keep their head down! This continues until the weapon runs out of ammo or until the shooter’s next round. This consumes ammunition equal to three times the weapon's Auto rating.
You may only perform one Suppressive Fire action per round.

Thrown Weapons
Thrown weapons an Effective range of five times the thrower’s STR characteristic; the Maximum range is twice that. Throw Athletics/DEX 8+ to hit with a thrown weapon at Effective range, or 10+ beyond it.
Throw Athletics/DEX 8+ to accurately throw a hand grenade at effective range, and 10+ to place a grenade on target at maximum range. Hand grenades. On a failure, the grenade will land 2D6+ (the margin of failure) meters from its intended target. At maximum range, thrown grenades automatically deviate 2D6 – (Effect) meters.

Blast Effects and Diving for Cover:
Modern weaponry include a wide variety of highly lethal explosive devices, like grenades (see above) and Gunnery weapons. Weapons with the Blast Weapon Aspect do their full damage to everyone within the blast radius. It is possible to reduce this damage by Diving for Cover. The character flings themselves down onto the ground: reduce damage by half, before applying armor. If there is sufficient cover readily available, the character can dive behind it and take only 1D damage before applying armor. What constitutes sufficient cover depends on the explosion and the Referee’s call. A foxhole or slit trench might be sufficient to avoid grenade blasts altogether. Hiding behind a low brick wall might only serve to increase the amount of shrapnel from an exploding artillery shell. Fusion guns tend to ignore most types of matter. The Referee is the final arbiter in these situations. In any case, a character that dives for cover forfeits their next action.

Optional Rule:  Dodge and Parry
Even though they cannot dodge bullets, skilled combatants are harder to hit. A proficient gunman can use the battlefield to avoid line-of sight. An expert swordsman will parry melee attacks. Therefore, for a more cinematic game where skilled heroes can take on multiple armed opponents, we propose the following optional rule. In ranged combat, apply the target’s Gun Combat skill (if any) as a negative DM to all incoming ranged attacks. In melee combat, apply the target’s Melee Combat skill (if any) as a negative DM to all incoming melee attacks. Immobile or unaware targets do not enjoy this defensive benefit. Note that this modifier is not cumulative with any cover modifiers; use the higher of the two modifiers when shooting at a target in cover.  The exception is a shield – a character using a shield in melee may still add DM-1 to be hit by enemies to the above penalty if they used one of their actions in the previous round for Overwatch with the shield.

Grappling
A character can attempt to wrestle or grab another person instead of hitting them. The attacker must move to melee combat range and beat their target in an opposed Melee Combat throw. If the attacker wins, they may do any one of the following:
•	Knock their opponent prone.
•	Disarm their opponent. If the attacker succeeds with an Effect of 6+ they can take the weapon for themselves; otherwise, it ends up on the floor.
•	Throw their opponent up to three meters for 1d6+STR DM damage.
•	Inflict damage equal to 2 + the Effect + STR DM. Grapple damage ignores armor except for Encased Armor Suits, Powered Armor, and Hostile Environment Spacesuits.
•	Escape the grapple and move away (as if with a normal movement action).
•	Continue the grapple with no other effects.
•	Drag or push their opponent up to three meters.
Throwing an opponent always ends the grapple. When using any of the other option above, the winner of the opposed test can choose to end or continue the grapple as they see fit, even if they did not initiate it. A character in a grapple cannot move or do anything other than make opposed Melee checks. Each time an opposed check is made the winner can choose an option from the above list. A character who won the grapple in the previous round enjoys DM+1 to the next grapple; this is not cumulative regardless of the number of grapples they have successively won.

Damage and Healing
To determine the amount of damage a successful hit inflicts, check the weapon’s damage rating. Each weapon has a number of damage dice: roll them, add the attack throw’s Effect. In melee attacks or when using thrown melee weapons, add the character’s STR DM to the damage (for a minimum of 1 damage in case of a negative STR DM). This is the damage inflicted on the character.

Armor
Subtract the armor’s protection rating from any physical damage caused to the character before applying the damage to the character’s Stamina and Lifeblood.

Optional Rule: Armor as a Penalty to Hit
Armor in the core TevellerRPG rules absorbs damage. However, some players and Referees prefer armor to render its wearer harder to hit, rather than absorb damage. For such groups, we present the following simple rules.

	None	Leather
Jacket	Bulletproof
Vest	Heavy Ballistic	Space Suit	Heavy Duster	Encased or Synth Silk	Powered Armor
Natural Weapons	0	-1	-2	-3	-3	-2	-4	-5
Bludgeoning Weapons	0	-1	-2	-3	-3	-2	-4	-5
Slashing & Piercing Weapons	0	-1	-3	-2	-2	-3	-3	-5
Slug Weapons	0	0	-1	-3	-3	-1	-3	-5
Assault Weapons	0	0	0	-1	-1	0	-2	-4
Laser Weapons	0	0	-2	-2	-2	-2	-3	-5
Heavy Weapons	0	0	0	0	0	0	-1	-3
The above modifiers are penalties to hit. All other modifier DMs to hit, like Cover and Darkness, apply as usual. Under this optional rule, of course, armor does not reduce damage; any hit causes regular damage dice without any reduction.
Weapon Notes
Shotguns (+2) against jack or less in effective range. Treated as a slug weapon.
Natural Weapons include Hands, Claws, Teeth, Horns, Hooves, Stingers, and Thrashers, or any similar bodily weapon.
Bludgeoning Weapons include Clubs, Batons, and so on.
Piercing Weapons include Bayonet, Spear, Halberd, Pike, Foil, Bows, and similar.
Slashing Weapons include Dagger, Blade, Cutlass, Sword, Broadsword, etc.
Slug Weapons include Body Pistol, Handgun, Revolver, Carbine, Shotgun, SMG, and similar light small arms.
Assault Weapons include Rifles, Assault Rifles, Gauss Rifles, Pulse Rifles, Light Machine Guns, and similar rifle-scale small arms.
Lasers include all laser-based weapons, including Blasters.
Heavy Weapons include GMPGs, explosives, Plasma Weapons, Fusion Weapons, and similar heavy heavy weapons.

Applying Damage
TevellerRPG uses two attributes to denote a character’s resistance to damage. The first is Stamina, which represents the character’s toughness and ability to shrug off minor wounds. Lifeblood is the character’s health: loss of Lifeblood represents more serious damage.
After any successful attack, apply damage, after first subtracting armor. All damage is first applied to the target’s Stamina. After Stamina reaches zero, any excess or additional damage is then applied to the target’s Lifeblood.

Knockdown
If a character receives more damage, before armor is applied, in one round than double their DEX score, they are knocked prone. This rule applies even when the character otherwise receives no damage at all thanks to armor. Characters in Powered Armor quadruple their DEX for calculating their knockdown threshold.

Wounds
If Stamina is above zero, the character is not wounded, only bruised, or scuffed. No negative effects apply to the character in this case.
If the character suffers Lifeblood damage, but their Lifeblood is above one half its full rating, the character suffers a Minor Wound and applies DM-1 to all actions until healed.
If Lifeblood falls below half its full rating, the character is Seriously Wounded; they must throw END 8+ or fall unconscious for 1D hours. Upon waking, the character suffers DM-2 to all actions until healed. The character will require medical care to recover any further.
Characters suffer a Mortal Wound if their Lifeblood reaches zero. A mortally wounded character will die within 1 hour unless they undergo Trauma Surgery, as described below. In extreme cases, when the character suffers massive damage, the Referee may declare that they die immediately.

Optional Rule: Heroes and Grunts
For a cinematic game where heroes cut their way through waves of grunts (also called mooks, or occasionally “extras”), the Referee may rule that, in personnel combat, any attack penetrating armor knocks a grunt out of combat. This rarely means death unless the damage is massive. However, in such heroic tales, grunts often cower after being hurt, are preoccupied by their (sometimes minor) wounds, or pass out after being hit by the hero. Reviving such mooks for interrogation after combat is often easy, though the information available from them is usually limited.

Healing and Medical Care
Stamina recovers on its own to its full rating within 10 minutes after combat. A character’s stamina recovers even if they have received Minor Wounds. Stamina does not recover for characters who receive Serious or Mortal Wounds.
Minor Wounds require treatment by a character with at least Medicine-1, a Medkit, and 30 minutes of time. With either Medicine-1 or a Med Kit, rather than both, treatment will take 1 hour. Alternatively, characters will recover from all Minor Wounds on their own after a full day’s rest. This will restore the character’s Lifeblood to its full rating.
Serious Wounds require a medical facility—a standard starship medbay will suffice—and treatment by a nurse or a physician (Medicine-2 skill or better). Recovery takes 1 day per point of Lifeblood below half the full Lifeblood rating. Once the character’s Lifeblood reaches half its full rating, the character will recover the other half within another day of treatment.
Mortal Wounds require Trauma Surgery, as noted below.

Trauma Surgery
The key to trauma surgery is to bring the mortally wounded character to a hospital within the "Golden Hour" of trauma medicine – that is, within one hour after receiving mortal injury. Even with advanced first aid, critically injured characters whose Lifeblood was reduced to zero will not survive without trauma care after an hour of injury.
Ordinary medbays common on most starships will usually not suffice – a dedicated hospital, whether shipboard or planetside, is the only facility capable of performing such medical operations safely. If no hospital is reachable within one hour, a character with the Medicine skill may attempt field surgery, but, as noted below, this applies a significant penalty to the roll. Also note that characters killed by vehicle-scale or starship-scale weapons cannot be resuscitated.
Once on the operating table, the surgeon treating the critically injured character throws 2D + their Medicine skill, modified by the DMs below, and consults the following table.
Trauma Surgery Table
2D	Result
5-	Death
6-7	Significant internal damage
8-10	Radical measures required
11+	Normal recovery
Trauma Surgery DMs:
DM-2 if no first aid provided within 10 minutes of the injury.
DM-2 if operating in a ship’s med bay, and not a proper hospital.
DM-4 if operating under unsuitable field conditions.
DM-2 if treated with TL6 equipment-; DM+2 if treated with TL12+ equipment.
DM-2 if Mortally Wounded by an explosion.
DM-2 if patient has END 5-, DM+2 if patient has END 10+.

Trauma Surgery Results
Patient is dead: character dies on the operating table. No further resuscitation attempts possible. However, see Cyborg Conversion and Bio-Reconstruction, in Appendix XX.
Significant internal damage: multiple organs severely damaged. Permanently subtract 1D from each physical characteristic. If any of them reaches zero or less, the character dies.
TL9+ vat-grown or cybernetic organs restore full functioning and costs 1D x 2500 Credits – no throws required.
Radical measures required: Throw 1D:
1: internal organ removed. Permanently reduce one physical characteristic by 1D. Character dies if it reaches zero or less.
TL9+ vat-grown or cybernetic organ restores full functioning and costs Cr2500 – no throws required.
2-3: leg amputated. Movement halved (given a crutch) and the character may either act or move during a given round.
See the Cybernetics section of the Equipment section for replacement options.
4-5: arm amputated. The character obviously cannot use this arm for any purpose.
See the Cybernetics section of the Equipment section for replacement options.
6: eye removed. DM-2 to all actions requiring one eye, including all attack throws.
See the Cybernetics section of the Equipment section for replacement options.
Normal recovery: heal as normal for a Seriously Wounded character.

Vehicle Combat
Sometimes, characters will find themselves operating a vehicle in combat, or facing enemy vehicles. The following rules allow the inclusion of vehicles in personal combat, as well as vehicle chases. They are not intended to serve as war-gaming rules for large engagements.

Vehicle Movement
In tactical (non-chase) combat, a vehicle moves on its driver's initiative. Apply the vehicle's Agility as a DM to the driver's initiative.
In personal combat, a vehicle can move up to 20m in a single round. This is considered cautious combat movement. This represents a vehicle advancing slowly through terrain to engage personnel and other vehicles at so-called “knife-fighting” ranges and speeds. Fast-moving vehicles will pass through the tactical battle area in a round, or less. The chase rules below are designed to handle such high-speed combats. An exception would be a one-time intervention of a fast vehicle in tactical combat, such as an armed aircar doing a quick laser strafe of enemy positions during its pass through the area.

Chases
The tactical combat rules represent action in small, limited areas. For vehicles, this means short range and slow speeds. As noted above, a fast-moving vehicle will easily pass through the entire tactical combat map in less than one combat round. This is unsuitable for chases and dogfighting. Use these rules instead in such cases. They are designed to be highly descriptive in their approach to vehicle combat. It will be up to the Referee and the players to describe how the action unfolds as the participants maneuver, jockey for position, and attack each other.
Chase turns are an abstraction in combat and vary in length depending on circumstances, from mere seconds in high-speed aircraft pursuits to hours in long drawn-out submarine duels. The Referee should inform the players of how long each chase combat turn is at the start of the chase.
There is no initiative throw in chases. Instead, at the start of each turn both participants throw 1D + the relevant Vehicle Skill + Attribute DM + the vehicle's Agility. The pursuer wins on ties. The attribute DM used in vehicle chases depends on the vehicle and context: most high-speed chases would use the DEX DM, while a naval duel might use INT or EDU—perhaps depending on the Tech Level, ranges, and vehicles involved.
The result of the 1D + Attribute DM + Vehicle Skill + Vehicle Agility is called the Position.
The participants in a chase can only attack those targets at an equal or lower Position. They may attack using the normal vehicle attack and damage rules, with the following modifiers based on the relative Position between the attacker and target.
Position Attack DM Table
Attacker is	DM to Attack Throws
In the same Position as the target	DM-2
1 or 2 Positions higher than the target	DM-1
3 or 4 Positions higher than the target	DM 0
5 or more Positions higher than the target	DM+1
Those vehicles in lower Positions cannot attack any vehicle with higher Position for that turn unless their vehicle has a turret-mounted weapon. Turret attacks made from a worse Position suffer DM-3 to hit. Note that there is no range tracking in these vehicle chase rules. This is intentional. The attack DM penalty for low-relative Positions reflects a bad angle of attack, or sub-optimal range for an attack, such as getting an enemy on your tail in aircraft dogfighting.
It is possible to have multiple parties engaged in a chase. Simply record the different Position results in descending order. The vehicles higher on the “ladder” may attack any vehicle below them, subtracting Positions to determine their Attack DM. This can be used to great effect in a dogfight, below.
Chases last five turns. At the end of the fifth turn, if the prey has not been stopped, disabled, or destroyed, the prey escapes and the chase ends.

Dogfighting
In a dogfight, two or more highly maneuverable vehicles, such as aircraft or grav vehicles, try to outmaneuver and fight each other. A dogfight usually has no time limit, barring fuel considerations. The dogfight ends either when one participant is disabled or destroyed, or if one participant disengages. To disengage from a dogfight, a participant must use an action that turn to throw Opposed Vehicle Skill/DEX, including the DM for the vehicle’s agility. The vehicle with superior Position gains Advantage on the skill check. If the pilot that initiated the disengagement attempt was successful, they have managed to end the dogfight, and cannot be attacked without first being chased down and re-engaged. For example, a fighter aircraft can break off the fight, and will be free to go its way unless its opponent gives pursuit.

Foot Chases
Chases on foot use similar rules. Each turn, each side throws opposed Athletics/DEX skills and records the result as their Position. The pursuer wins on ties. The winner of this opposed throw may attack in melee or ranged combat, at the Referee's discretion, while the loser cannot attack in that turn. Use the same Position Attack DM table as vehicle chases. Foot chases end in the same way that other chases end, that is, either when the pursuer subdues the prey or gives up the chase, or after five turns, when the prey escapes. Referees should track the number of turns and remember to consider Fatigue effects, if the situation calls for it.

Possible Vehicle Maneuvers: Chases
Evasive Maneuvers: To make it as difficult as possible to hit their vehicle, the pilot may attempt Evasive Maneuvers on their action.   Throw Vehicle Skill/DEX 8+ to gain the pilot’s Vehicle skill as a negative DM to attacks made until their next turn.
Better Position: While it is not normally possible to re-roll the Position throw in a round, it is possible to perform maneuvers to help ensure that your vehicle might be in a better Position next turn. For their action, the pilot of a vehicle may roll Vehicle Skill/DEX 8+ to gain a +1 bonus to next round’s Position throw. Note that it is possible for one vehicle to aid another allied vehicle to gain a Better Position on an enemy vehicle (see Collaboration in the Basic Rules chapter).
Obstacle Course: This risky maneuver is a good choice for agile vehicles desperate to get away from more heavily armed pursuers. The driver/pilot chooses an Obstacle Number, and then throws Vehicle Skill/DEX vs the Obstacle Number chosen (include the vehicle’s Agility score). If the throw fails, the vehicle crashes and is Knocked Out (see Vehicle Penetration and Damage, below) and everyone on board takes 3D damage. If the throw is successful, then the vehicle performing the maneuver can leave the chase, unless the pursuing vehicles opt to throw Vehicle Skill/DEX against the same Obstacle Number the first vehicle chose. If they fail, they crash and are Knocked Out. If they succeed, they continue the chase. If they do not opt to throw the Obstacle Number test, then they are out of the chase.
Ramming: For reasons we will not explore here, deliberately ramming another vehicle is a staple of gaming. In tactical combat, performing a ram requires one action by the vehicle pilot. The pilot must throw Vehicle Skill/DEX 8+ to hit a stationary target in combat. If the target is moving, the throw is opposed Vehicle/Skill/DEX. In both cases, add the Agility scores of the vehicles involved. Ramming a stationary vehicle outside of combat is automatically successful. However, if the ram is intended as a first strike, roll to determine Surprise, as normal. Characters who are not surprised may dive for cover to avoid taking damage. Vehicle crews that are not surprised may attempt to evade, making the ramming attack an opposed Vehicle Skill/DEX throw.
In a chase, performing a ram requires that the ramming vehicle have superior Position on the target. Rams cannot occur between two vehicles with the same Position. Ramming a target is an opposed Vehicle/DEX throw, where the vehicle with superior Position gains Advantage on the throw. Apply Agility and Position DMs to the throws. Chases assume that both vehicles are moving.
In both tactical and chase combat, see the collision damage rules below.

Collisions:
Characters hit by vehicles travelling at high speeds take 6D damage, subtracting armor. Referees may want to adjust damage to reflect extremely large (8D+) or very small vehicles (4D).
Vehicles that suffer uncontrolled high speed collisions or crashes are Destroyed, as per the Critical Damage table.
If a character is attempting to control a crash, Referees can assume that the vehicle will be Knocked Out, and that characters inside suffer damage accordingly.
Vehicles performing a ram on a target should use the following table to determine damage. If a ramming vehicle is significantly larger than the target vehicle, is travelling at significantly higher relative speeds, or is specifically fitted with a ram, treat the ramming vehicle as having one level higher armor than listed, and read off the next lower row.

Vehicle Collision Damage Matrix
	Target Vehicle:
Ramming Vehicle:	Unarmored	Light Armor	Heavy Armor
Unarmored	Surface	None	None
Light Armor	Internal	Internal	Surface
Heavy Armor	Critical	Critical	Internal
Heavy Armor w/Ram	Destroyed	Destroyed	Critical

Attacking Vehicles
When using a vehicle-mounted heavy weapon in tactical combat—not a chase—throw Heavy Weapons/DEX 8+ to hit a target in Effective range and 10+ to hit a target beyond it and up to its maximum range. Apply normal ranged combat modifiers to this roll. The Referee might rule that some heavy weapons ignore otherwise good cover (DM-2). Treat as target obscured (DM-1).
Throw Gunnery/DEX 8+ to hit a target with vehicle-mounted gunnery weapons at the Gunnery Weapon’s Effective range in tactical combat. Beyond Effective range, this throw becomes Gunnery/Dex 10+. Gunnery Weapons have very long ranges and for typical tactical engagements, Gunnery weapon targets will almost always be within Effective range. Hitting a human-sized target with a Gunnery weapon is penalized at DM-2.
Small arms and heavy weapon attacks on a stationary vehicle enjoy DM+1 due to the target’s size. Small arms and heavy weapon attacks on fast moving ground vehicle targets, or slow moving aircraft, helicopters, or grav vehicles are penalized by DM-2. Note that in many cases, attacks on aircraft are made beyond Effective range, meaning that the base difficulty for most personal attacks against slow-moving aircraft will be 12+.
Small arms and ground-fired Heavy weapons cannot hit fast-moving or high-altitude aircraft. There are a number of specialized anti-aircraft weapons available in the Equipment chapter.
Personal weapon attacks from a fast-moving vehicle, like a gunman firing a pistol out of the window of a moving car, are penalized by DM-2. This penalty is cumulative with attacking a fast-moving target, such as shooting your submachinegun from one moving vehicle at another moving vehicle. Note that this penalty applies in the Chase combat rules for vehicles as well.
At TL7+, Heavy and Gunnery weapons mounted on military vehicles use targeting computers and stabilization, and do not suffer the DM-2 for attacking from a fast-moving vehicle. Nor do such vehicles suffer penalties when firing at moving vehicles—in such a situation, the Referee should probably be using the Chase rules, where Position accounts for relative speed penalties.
A gunner may aim for a specific location on a target vehicle. Penalize the attack by DM-4. If the attack is successful and penetrates doing at least Internal Damage, it damages the called location. Otherwise, the shot misses completely.

Vehicle Combat Modifiers Table
Tactical Combat Condition	DM
Beyond Effective Range	DM-2
Attacking human sized target with Gunnery weapon	DM-2
Attacking from moving vehicle – unstable firing platform (applies to Chase combat as well)	DM-2
Attacking from moving vehicle, TL7+ (military vehicles)	DM+0
Attacking stationary vehicle	DM+1
Attacking fast moving ground target	DM-2
Attacking slow-moving aerial target	DM-2
Attacking fast-moving aerial target from the ground without specialized anti-aircraft equipment	Not Possible
Aiming for a specific location on a target vehicle	DM-4
Vehicle Penetration and Damage
When an attack hits a vehicle, refer to the Vehicle Penetration Matrix Table below and roll on the damage tables as indicated by that matrix. If an attack hits with an Effect of 6 or more, shift one column to the left to determine the damage. Note that if a given weapon does not have any AV hits listed in its description, it has 1 AV hit roll.

Device: One secondary external device, such as externally mounted cargo, a headlight, or antenna, is destroyed (Referee's discretion).
Locomotion: The vehicle's means of locomotion or engine is damaged.
First Hit: halve the vehicle's speed.
Second Hit: The vehicle's locomotion is disabled, and it cannot move. In case of aircraft or high-flying grav vehicles, this might cause a crash; throw Aircraft/DEX 8+ or Grav Vehicle/DEX 8+ respectively to land safely. Otherwise, the aircraft crashes: roll on the Critical Damage table
Breach: If the vehicle is pressurized, its environmental seal is breached, exposing its occupants to the environment. Patching an environmental seal breach requires pre-packaged emergency hull patches. Most sealed vehicles carry 1D hull patches, which may be used within one combat round of sustaining the damage; alternatively, sealing the breach requires Repair/INT 6+ throw and 1D minutes.
Note that a breached watercraft begins to leak. This reduces its speed by one quarter and reduces vehicle Agility by -1. Four breaches will cause the watercraft to take in too much water and sink. This only applies to small watercraft; large ships such as steamships and larger vessels stay afloat despite such minor breaches—they have compartmentalized hulls designed to prevent small breaches from sinking the whole ship. Only a Knocked Out critical result (see below) will sink large craft.
Weapon: One of the vehicle's weapons is disabled and may not fire. Determine which weapon randomly. Throw Repair/INT 8+ or Gunnery/INT 10+ to repair a disabled weapon. Subsequent hits against the same disabled weapon will damage the weapon to the point where it cannot be repaired in combat. If the vehicle survives the encounter, roll 1D: 1-3; the weapon is repairable, 4-6; the weapon is destroyed and must be replaced.
Internal Damage: The vehicle suffers an unlucky penetrating hit! Roll on the Internal Damage table!

Only a Knocked Out critical result (see below) will sink large craft.
Cargo: 1 ton of randomly determined cargo is destroyed. If no cargo remains, treat this as an Occupants result.
Occupants: 1D hits injure random vehicle occupants: crew or passengers. Each hit inflicts 3D damage. If there are fewer occupants than the rolled number of hits, distribute the hits randomly between the remaining occupants, which means that an occupant may suffer a double hit. Subtract personal armor from this damage if applicable. If the pilot suffers a hit and falls unconscious, a flying or fast-moving vehicle will crash (roll a Critical Hit) unless another character with the appropriate skill can grab the controls within one combat round; alternatively, in TL7+ vehicles the autopilot can take over; however, autopilots always lose Position chase throws.
Weapon: One of the vehicle's weapons is disabled and may not fire. Determine which weapon randomly. Throw Repair/INT 8+ or Gunnery/INT 10+ to repair a disabled weapon. Subsequent hits against the same disabled weapon will damage the weapon to the point where it cannot be repaired in combat. If the vehicle survives the encounter, roll 1D: 1-3; the weapon is repairable, 4-6; the weapon is destroyed and must be replaced.
Locomotion: The vehicle's locomotion or engine is damaged.
First Hit: halve the vehicle's speed.
Second Hit: The vehicle's locomotion is disabled, and it cannot move. In case of aircraft or high-flying grav vehicles, this might cause a crash; throw Aircraft/DEX 8+ or Grav Vehicle/DEX 8+ respectively to land safely. Otherwise, the aircraft crashes: roll on the Critical Damage table
Electronics: One of the vehicle's electronic systems is destroyed: usually the computer systems or major sensors/radar. Flying an aircraft or Grav vehicle with damaged electronics incurs a DM-2 penalty to all vehicle throws.
Power Plant: The vehicle's power plant takes a direct hit.
First Hit: the power plant is damaged; halve the vehicle's speed (cumulative with Locomotion damage). The vehicle cannot fire energy weapons and move in the same round.
Second hit: the power plant is destroyed; the vehicle is immobilized and cannot use electronics or energy weapons. Aircraft or grav vehicles may crash: throw Aircraft/DEX 8+ or Grav Vehicle/DEX 8+ to land safely, otherwise roll on the Critical Damage table.
Critical: The vehicle suffers massive internal damage. Roll on the Critical Damage table below.

6 or less	Knocked Out
7-9	Crew Hit
10 or more	Destroyed

Critical Damage
Knocked Out: The vehicle is seriously damaged and inoperable until it undergoes major repairs at a full-scale workshop. Each occupant must throw END 6+ to avoid taking 3D damage. Aircraft and grav vehicles at high altitudes crash, causing 6D damage to all occupants. Low-flying vehicles crash, causing 3D damage to all occupants. Subtract personal armor from this damage if applicable.  Watercraft, including large vessels, suffer a massive hull breach. They will sink within 1D combat rounds.
Crew Hit: All crew and passengers suffer 4D damage each. Personal armor reduces this damage accordingly.
Destroyed: The vehicle is destroyed with the loss of all hands. In the case of ground vehicles, occupants may throw DEX 8+ to bail out unscathed; failure causes 5D damage.

Repairs
Throw Repair/INT 8+ to jury-rig a damaged or disabled system back to functional status with a handful of spare parts. These repairs are temporary. The system will stop functioning again after 1D hours. Breaches are easier to repair, as noted above.
Properly repairing a disabled system costs 2D6x10% of the system’s original cost. Throw Repair/INT or Repair/EDU 10+ to repair the system in the field using spare parts. If this throw is unsuccessful, the damage requires a workshop to repair. Unless the Referee decrees that the vehicle itself is damaged beyond repair, a character with at least the Repair 1 skill will be able to replace or repair the system, at this cost, at a properly equipped workshop.

Ground Force Weaponry against Starship-scale Targets
All spacecraft are immune to Small Arm fire. Heavy weapons that hit an unarmored space craft of 99 tons or less will cause one ship surface hit. Roll for damage location normally, per the Space Combat chapter. Gunnery weapons are significantly more dangerous. They can harm small craft of 99 or smaller tons: Gunnery weapons inflict one Internal hit on a successful attack. Against ships between the 100-999-ton range, Gunnery weapons inflict one Surface hit. Spacecraft of 1000 or more tons are immune to non-specialized ground weapons.

Starship-Scale Weaponry against Vehicle Targets
Civilian ship lasers are considered Gunnery Weapons vs. vehicles. Civilian ship missiles are considered Heavy weapons but cause 1D AV hits when penetrating vehicle armor. Any heavier starship weapons will destroy any vehicle on a successful hit. Any starship weapons will utterly vaporize human-sized targets.
