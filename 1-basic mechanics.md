Basic Rules
Die Roll Conventions
TevellerRPG is powered by the Cepheus Engine, and uses common six-sided dice. We note each die you need to roll as a “D”. Unless noted otherwise, “2D”, for example, means “roll two dice and add the results together”.
In this game, DM means Dice Modifier – a number you add or subtract from a dice roll. For example, “2D, DM-2” means “roll two dice, add the results together, and then subtract 2 from the total”.
Another die roll type is “D66”. In that case, throw two six-sided dice, but do not add the results together. Instead, use one die as the “tens” and the other as the “ones”, providing 36 results.

The basic game mechanic
The basic mechanic of TevellerRPG is the throw, and when we say this, we mean dice throw. Throw 2D, add the relevant skill and characteristic DMs, and if the total is equal or higher than the target number, you succeed. For example, “throw Athletics/STR 8+” means “throw 2D and add your Athletics skill level and Strength Dice Modifiers; if the total is 8 or more, you succeed” The amount by which your total throw exceeds or misses the target number is called the Effect.
If a task is even remotely feasible, a natural (unmodified) roll of 2 is always a failure, while a natural (unmodified) roll of 12 is always a success. This is regardless of target numbers or further circumstances.
Opposed throws: in a situation where two characters oppose each other in an attempt, for example, a spy trying to sneak past a guard, each character throws 2D plus the appropriate skill and characteristic modifier; the higher roll wins. On a tie, the character with the higher total DM to the throw (from skill, characteristics, etc.) wins. If both characters are equally competent, reroll the tie.
Unskilled characters: if a character attempts a throw with a skill they do not possess, they suffer DM-3 to that throw.
Trying Again: generally, you may retry failed skill or characteristic throws. However, in some cases failure has consequences: failing a Demolitions throw might mean having a bomb explode in your face. This instance precludes the possibility of second chances.
Note that skilled characters are competent and can usually practice their trade or profession, under normal conditions, without a throw. Use throws only when the characters are at serious risk or under pressure, such as time pressure, opposition, or adverse conditions. For example, a physician (Medicine 3) can give effective first aid without requiring a throw and can help characters recover from serious wounds but would have to make a Medicine throw to treat a genetically engineered disease.

Collaboration
In some cases, characters may work together on a task throw. The character with the highest skill and characteristic makes the main skill throw. Any assistant can make a skill throw at the same difficulty as well; if they succeed, add DM+1 to the primary character’s throw; if they fail, the primary character suffers no penalty. There can only be one assistant to the main skill throw. However, the Referee is encouraged to allow other characters to assist the assistant. Each throw has the same difficulty as the original skill throw. Note that characters who are assisting in the throw do not necessarily have to use the same skill. If the player and Referee agree, a related skill task throw can assist. For example, a ship’s engineer might throw Engineering to assist the Pilot’s skill throw. Teamwork!

Common Target Numbers
The table below provides guidelines for Referees to set Target Numbers. Any Target Number below 4+ is probably not worth calling for a throw.
Difficulty	Target Number	Examples
Easy	6+	Repairing a damaged vehicle system in a properly equipped workshop
Average	8+	Shooting a target in Effective range
Difficult	10+	Shooting a target beyond Effective range
Formidable	12+	Landing a ship in a hurricane with a damaged engine, under enemy fire
Impossible	14+	Anything that the Referee would find amusing

Advantage
In certain advantageous situations, specifically related to Traits and cybernetics, the rules may grant you an Advantage. In this case, throw 3D, and choose the 2 highest die results.

Fatigue
Fatigue is common in the demanding sci-fi future. When Fatigued, a character suffers DM-2 to all throws. 8 hours of rest remove Fatigue.

Optional Rule: Hero Points
The TevellerRPG rules present a universe of gritty heroism: heroes can be powerful, but they are still human and constrained by this harsh reality. However, if you desire larger-than-life science-fiction heroes, use the following rule.
Each player starts each game session with 2 personal Hero Points. The group also has an additional number of Hero Points equal to the number of players present that session.
Each time a player fails in a skill or characteristic throw of at least 8+ with an Effect of 6 or more, the group Hero Point pool increases by 1.
Each time a player succeeds in a skill or characteristic throw of at least 8+ with an Effect of 6 or more, their own Hero Point pool increases by 1.
All pools reset at the beginning of each session.
A character may use their personal Hero Points, and with the other players' agreement, points from the group pool.
By spending Hero Points, a character may:
•	Reroll any single die throw, including damage throws and vehicle or ship damage and critical hits. They may pick the better result.
•	Force the Referee to reroll a single NPC's die throw, including damage throws and vehicle or ship damage and critical hits. The second result stands, so watch out!
•	Reroll a throw on the Trauma Surgery, Cyborg Conversion, or Bio-Reconstruction tables. They may take the better result.

Optional Rule: Only Individual Hero Points
For a more modest Hero Point system, ignore the Group Hero Point Pool and only grant Individual Hero Points.
