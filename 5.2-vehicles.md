Vehicles
Science fiction stories often feature wild chases, armored warfare, or exploration of remote planets by all sorts of vehicles. A wide variety of vehicles exist across cultures and species for planetary, atmospheric, and oceanic transportation. The following is a list of a few of the more common conveyances.
Characters may purchase a vehicle at its base Tech Level or on any higher TL. Higher-tech vehicles typically have greater range and endurance, at the Referee’s discretion.

Stat Block Explanation
Tech Level (TL): technological level, as noted above.
Cost: in thousands of Credits (KCr).
Agility: represents the vehicle’s maneuverability. Applies as a DM to skill and Position throws in vehicle combat.
Speed: top speed in km/h; cruising speed is 75% of the listed top speed; off-road speed is equal to 50% of top speed.
Range: how far the vehicle can go at cruising speed before refueling. Given in kilometers.
Armor: the vehicle’s Armor Class: Unarmored, Light, or Heavy.
Crew/Passengers: the first number shows the number of crewmembers the vehicle requires; the second, the number of passengers it may carry.
Cargo: dedicated cargo capacity in kilograms or tons.
Weapons: weapons included in the vehicle’s price by default. Heavy weapons use the Heavy Weapons skill. Gunnery weapons use the Gunnery skill.
Active Countermeasures: When a vehicle equipped with Active Countermeasures is attacked by a rocket, missile, or grenade, throw 2D; on 7+, the Countermeasures intercept the munition, neutralizing the attack.

Cepheus Engine SRD/Core Conversion Note
To convert Cepheus Engine SRD/Core vehicle armor to TevellerRPG, use the following table:

CE: SRD/Core Armor Rating	TevellerRPG Armor Class
6 or lower	Unarmored
7-24	Light
25 or higher and/or Hull/Structure of 40/40 or greater	Heavy

When using vehicles from other Cepheus Engine books that use multiple armor ratings, such as different armor for each vehicle facings, simply average the armor rating (rounding down fractions) and consult the table above.
