Injury Rules
You should roll on the following Injury Table whenever an Event result says so. In this case, the character suffers an injury, but may continue their career.
Note that this is the far future; maimed characters can rely on cybernetics for recovery. Deduct the cost of cybernetics listed below from the character’s starting funds. If the funds run out, and medical cybernetics debt remains, the character owes money to someone powerful: a government, a corporation, or an organized crime syndicate.
Upon being injured, throw END 6+, note the throw’s Effect, and consult the following table.
Injury Table
Effect	Result
-6 or less	The character is nearly killed. Reduce one physical characteristic by 1D, and both other physical characteristics by 2 (or one of them by 4). Roll 1D: 1-2, the character loses a leg; 3-4, the character loses an arm; 5, the character loses an eye; 6, the character loses both eyes.
-5 to -2	Character is severely injured with severe lasting implications. Reduce one physical characteristic by 1D. Roll 1D: 1, character loses a leg; 2, character loses an arm; 3, character loses both eyes; 4-6, the character is otherwise unharmed.
-1 to +0	Character is injured with lasting implications. Roll 1D: 1-2, character loses a hand; 3-4, character loses one eye; 5, character loses an arm; 6, reduce one physical characteristic by 2.
+1 to +5	Character is injured and suffers mild lasting injuries. Roll 1D: 1-2, character is badly scarred; 3-4, character loses 1D fingers; 5, character loses most teeth; 6, reduce one physical characteristic by 1.
+6 or more	Lightly injured. No permanent effects.
DMs: -2 if the character is a Pirate or a Scout; -1 if in a military career; +0 if civilian.

Injury Effects
Below are the effects of injury, followed by a table presenting cybernetic replacement costs.
Blinded: The character loses both eyes to injury and is blind and may not perform any task requiring sight.
Lost Arm: One of the character's arms must be amputated to save their life. The character obviously cannot use this arm for any purpose.
Lost Fingers: The character loses several fingers to injury. He or she suffers from DM-2 to all checks related to that specific hand.
Lost Hand: One of the character's hands must be amputated as part of medical care, though surgery saves most of the arm. The character loses all uses of the hand.
Lost Leg: One of the character's legs must be amputated to save his or her life. The character cannot move unaided other than by crawling. Using a crutch or a wheelchair, the character may move 3 meters per minor action.
Lost One Eye: The character is blinded in one eye but retains the other, losing depth perception and drastically reducing their field of view. The character retains vision but suffers DM-2 to all actions requiring depth perception, such as ranged attacks. The penalty should also be applied to any check related to having a full field of vision, such as noticing someone sneaking up on the character.
Lost Teeth: Most of the characters' teeth are knocked out, making eating difficult causing DM-2 to all checks involving speech.
Physical Characteristic: The character’s characteristics are reduced due to lingering physiological, neurological, and psychological damage. Adjust attribute DMs accordingly.
Scarring: The character suffers extensive and lasting scars or burn marks from his or her injury. The character is easily recognizable and suffers DM-2 to all social checks, except for intimidation in which they enjoy DM+2.

Repairing Injuries
Thankfully, advanced cybernetics allow the restoration of even the worst injuries. The following table presents corrective surgery and cybernetic options, along with their minimum tech levels and Cybernetic Points cost. See the Cybernetics section in the Equipment chapter for more information on cybernetics and Cybernetic Points.

Corrective Cybernetics
Injury	Implant or Surgery	TL	Cost (Cr)	Cybernetic Points
Blindness	Pair of Cybereyes	9	10,000	2
Lost arm	Cyberarm	9	6,000	1
Lost fingers	Cyberfingers	9	500 each	0
Lost hand	Cyberhand	9	1,500	1
Lost leg	Cyberleg	9	9,000	1
Lost one eye	Cybereye	9	5,000	1
Lost teeth	Dental reconstruction	6	2,500	0
Physical Characteristic	Therapy and internal cybernetics	9	3,000/point	1/injury
Scarring	Plastic surgery	7	3,000	0

Optional Rule: IRON MAN!
For players and Referees seeking a hardcore, old-school experience, treat any Injury on the event tables during character generation as character death – requiring the generation of a new character from the start!
