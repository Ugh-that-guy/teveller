Space Combat
The spacelanes can be dangerous. Pirates lurk near gas giants and jump points. Vessels belonging to enemy interstellar polities might raid a system and prey on the player characters’ ship. The player characters might decide to engage in some piracy themselves, or they may be the crew of a patrol frigate that has found some pirates or raiders. Use the following rules to run the combat action on such occasions.

Space Combat Basics
Ships typically fight at a range of several thousand, or tens of thousands, kilometers. However, TevellerRPG abstracts ranges in ship combat. There is no need to track ranges, though creative Referees and players might describe their maneuverings and tactics in terms of range.
Space combat typically occurs in 6-minute rounds. This time accounts for weapon recharge cycles and long-range missile travel, as well as emergency repairs. Since range is abstracted using the Position mechanic (below), it is possible to run space combats at different time frames. This allows for furious dogfights between fighters, intense chases as smugglers attempt to run blockades, as well as nail-bitingly slow cat-and-mouse actions between pirates and patrol frigates, all using the same basic rules.
However long a round is in space combat, in each round every crew member may take one action, as detailed below. This means that crew members staffing two posts – such as a pilot also serving as a captain – must choose only one post they are filling in each round. This is the main reason most larger ships, and all military vessels, have dedicated captain and specialized personnel for each crew position. A character may occupy two positions at once, but in each given round, they may only act in one position. For example, smaller civilian starships often have the pilot double as the captain. In such cases, the character must choose every round if they take a piloting action or a captain's command action.

Position
There is no initiative or range to track in space combat. Each space combat round, all participating ships' pilots throw 1D + Piloting skill + DEX DM + their ship's current maneuver drive thrust number. The attribute DM used in space combat is usually DEX, but in some circumstances the Referee might call for INT or EDU DMs to be used instead.
The result of the 1D + Attribute DM + Pilot Skill + Maneuver Drive Thrust number is called the Position.
The ships in a space battle can only attack those targets in equal or lower Position to themselves, without restrictions. A ship with better Position may choose when to take its turn – before or after its opponents. All characters on a ship act on its turn. They can attack with any weapon on board their vessel, using the following modifiers based on the relative Position between attacker and target.
Ships with lower Positions suffers DM-3 to attack anyone with a higher Position number than them, in a given round. This penalty applies to turrets and bays. Weapons in fixed mounts or Main Guns cannot attack without Position. However, a successful Attack Vector Pilot action will allow for ships with fixed mounts or Main Guns to attack, albeit at DM-3. Note that two vessels that have the same result for their Position throw can still attack each other with all weapons, albeit at DM-2 to their attack throws.
Position Attack DM Table
Attacker is	DM to Attack Throws
Inferior Position with Main Guns or Fixed Mounts	No attack possible
Inferior Position with Turrets	DM-3
Inferior Position with Main Guns or Fixed Mounts and successful Attack Vector action	DM-3
In the same Position as the target	DM-2
1 or 2 Positions higher than the target	DM-1
3 or 4 Positions higher than the target	DM 0
5 or more Positions higher than the target	DM+1

Vessels with disabled Maneuver drives automatically lose Position. Note that space stations with a thrust of 0 roll Position normally. They simply do not have a bonus from maneuver drives. Instead of Piloting, station commanders throw 1D + Tactics + INT DM for Position. It is difficult, but not impossible, to stay in the blind spot of a station-mounted turret.
It is possible to have multiple ships engaged in combat. Simply record the different Position results in descending order. The ships higher on the “Position ladder” have better Position on any ship below them.
Actions
Each character may act once in each combat round. There are five positions aboard a ship: Captain, Pilot, Sensor Operator, Gunner, and Engineer, each with its own actions. There may be only one character performing an action at a given station, with the exception of Gunners: there is one gunner per turret, bay, or main weapon on a ship. Other characters can assist one of the positions in performing their actions below, according to the rule for collaborating on skill throws found in the Basic Rules chapter.

Captain Actions
The ship’s captain may engage in one of the following actions:
Lead Crew: throw Leadership/INT 8+. If successful, gain a pool of positive DM points equal to the Effect (minimum 1) that the captain may distribute as they see fit for the next round. For example, a roll of 12 generates a pool of 4 points, which can be given to one crewmember for a DM+4, or to four separate crewmembers, for a DM+1 each.
Outmaneuver: the captain throws Tactics/INT 10+. If successful, apply a DM+2 to the ship's next round's Position throw.

Pilot Actions
The pilot may take one of the following actions, in addition to the free Position throw they make at the start of each round.
Attack Vector: the pilot may throw Piloting/DEX 8+ and apply the Effect to a single weapon’s attack throws for the round. This throw is not modified by the ship’s thrust rating. If the Effect of the throw is 1 or greater, the pilot may distribute the Effect "points" as positive DMs to various weapons.  Alternatively, if the ship does not have Position, this action allows firing fixed weapons or Main Guns at the enemy, albeit at DM-3 to hit. In this case, no positive DMs can be distributed to fixed guns.
Dock: Docking is only possible with a friendly ship, or with an enemy ship without a functional maneuver drive. You may not dock with an actively maneuvering enemy ship.
Disengage: To disengage from ship combat, a ship can use their Pilot action that round to throw a Piloting/DEX opposed skill throw vs. the pursuer's Pilot/DEX, adding each ship’s thrust rating to their respective throws. Whoever has Position gains Advantage on the roll for that round. The quarry escapes immediately if it wins the opposed throw. In a situation where a ship is attempting to escape multiple targets, use the Pilot skill and thrust rating from the fastest ship of the pursuing side against the lowest thrust rating of the target. Alternatively, a jump-capable ship may jump out of combat, as described below.
Evasive Maneuvers: the pilot throws Piloting/DEX 12+, modified by the ship’s available maneuver drive thrust rating.  On a success, apply a negative DM equal to the Pilot’s skill (to a maximum of DM-3) to all incoming attacks. This does not require Position, and lasts until the start of the ship’s next turn.
Plot Jump: Plotting a jump requires the pilot's attention for 6 – (Pilot Skill) space combat rounds. As well, the pilot must succeed at a Piloting/EDU 6+ throw, with a negative DM equal to the distance in parsecs. It is also possible to plot a jump in one round, but this raises the difficulty to Piloting/EDU 10+. A failed throw means that the jump must be plotted again.
Emergency Jump: throw Piloting/INT 6+ to initiate an emergency jump while under fire; if successful, the ship’s engineer must throw Engineering/INT 8+ to power the jump. Failures may be re-rolled in the next round. See the Ship Operations chapter above for the jump procedure itself. Note this applies DM-2 to the Jump Throw, increasing the chance of misjump. This requires a jump plot, as noted above – either prepared beforehand or generated during combat.

Sensor Operator Actions
The ship’s sensor operator may act as follows:
Spoof Missiles: Electronic warfare can defeat incoming missiles; throw Computer/INT 8+ to spoof an incoming missile due to impact that round, or the next round. The sensor operator must roll to successfully spoof each missile. Multiple missiles may be spoofed each round up to the Sensor Operators Computer skill (minimum of 1 attempt).
Jam Sensors: Electronic warfare can provide “cover” to a ship. Roll Opposed Computer/EDU against one enemy vessel, modified by the ships’ Computer DMs. If successful, the target of the Jamming suffers a negative DM to any attack roll made against the jamming ship. The negative DM is equal to the skill level of the Sensor Operator. This action is cumulative with a pilot's Evasive Maneuver action.
Scan: throw Computer/EDU 8+ to detect vessels and other objects; this throw is modified by the ship’s sensor DM and by the target’s stealth, if any.
Target Systems: throw Computer/EDU 10+, modified by the ship’s Electronics DM. If successful, a single gunner may choose to target a specific system on the enemy ship with one attack. If that gunner’s next attack is successful and does damage, they may select which system the attack has hit.
Sensor Lock: throw Computer/INT 8+, modified by the ship’s Electronics DM. As well, apply a negative DM equal to the target ship’s Electronics DM (DM+0 and lower do not count). If successful, all attacks against the locked ship gain a DM+1. The sensor lock lasts until the ship attempts to lock onto another target, or it is broken by the target.
Break Sensor Lock: throw Computer/INT 10+, modified by the ship’s Electronics DM. As well, apply a negative DM equal to the attacker’s ship Electronics DM (DM+0 and lower do not count). If successful, the existing Sensor Lock is broken.
Gunner Actions
Each gunner may take one of the following actions. Note that a gunner in a turret may fire all the weapons in that turret using different actions, once per round. For example, a gunner in a turret with a Beam Laser, a Pulse Laser, and a Missile Rack may fire the Beam Laser, launch a missile, and engage in point defense with the Pulse laser.
Fire Energy Weapons: throw Gunnery/DEX 8+ to hit a target with an energy weapon such as a laser, particle beam, meson gun, or fusion gun in their turret. For bays and main guns, the Chief Gunner of each such weapon makes a Gunnery/INT 8+ throw to hit the target.
Launch Missiles: the gunner launches one missile per rack in the turret. A missile cluster fires a salvo of five missiles, while a missile bank fires a salvo of 12 missiles. Throw Gunnery/INT 8+ before launch to lock the missiles on their target. Failure to lock prevents launching but keeps the missiles ready for launch in the future. If a Sensor Lock exists on the target (see Sensor Operator actions, above), no missile lock throw is required.
Missiles ignore Position modifiers to hit but are vulnerable to point-defense fire and electronic warfare spoofing. Missiles will hit their target at the end of the next round after their launch, allowing the targeting ship to attack missiles with point-defense and spoofing, if desired. On the round that the missiles reach their target, throw 4+ to hit the target, unmodified by any skill. The Evasive Maneuvers Pilot action affects this missile attack throw. Smart missiles that miss the first round may retry this throw once in the following round, after which they are no longer viable.
Point Defense: any energy weapon can perform point defense fire against incoming missiles, though pulse lasers are the most effective for this task. Throw Gunnery/DEX 10+ to destroy an incoming missile, with DM+2 if using a pulse laser. The gunner may make multiple point defense attacks with the same turret weapon in the same action, but each attack after the first suffers from a cumulative DM-1, so the third shot, for example, will suffer DM-2 to hit the missile. Using this basic rule, throw against each incoming missile, but note that unlike regular attacks, here the gunner may try to gun down multiple missiles per combat round, with the penalty noted above. If a turret has multiple energy weapons in a turret being used for Point Defense, each weapon is rolled for separately – negative DMs for multiple attacks to not transfer between weapons. However, all weapons in a given turret must be used for point defense against missiles coming from the same enemy ship.
Launch Sand: the gunner may launch sand canisters to serve as a defensive screen. Throw Gunner/DEX 6+ to apply a DM-1 to all weapons and sensor locks from a single ship for one round. Multiple canisters stack their DM to a maximum of DM-3. Canisters last for one round, until the ship’s next turn.
Note: each weapon in a double or triple turret has its own attack throw. However, energy weapons mounted in the same turret may only attack the same target. The gunner may launch missiles at any desired target. Also note that weapons mounted on a fixed mount cannot be used to attack unless the vessel has Position. Each weapon within a given turret can only shoot once per combat round, except when used for point defense. A gunner may fire all or some of the weapons in the same turret at the same round. In a triple turret, a gunner can fire all three weapons every turn.
Finally, note that, for the sake of simplicity, a missile rack, or torpedo launcher or torpedo bay must fire all its missiles against a single target each round.

Optional Rule: Streamlined Turret Fire
To reduce the amount of die rolls in ship combat, we recommend that for ships with more than 3 turrets, each double or triple turret should carry the same type of weapons. This allows all weapons to share the same attack throw but attacking at DM+1 for a double turret or at DM+2 for a triple turret. Damage is for one weapon only—we abstract the other weapons’ contributions as increasing the chances of scoring a hit. Under this optional rule, all weapons in such a turret must attack the same target. If launching missiles, all missiles in the same turret share a single locking throw but hit their target individually. We recommend that when using the streamlined turret fire rules, you should also use the streamlined point defense rules (see below) for the sake of simplicity.

Optional Rule: Streamlined Point Defense for ships up to 999 tons
In large battles involving large numbers of missiles and lasers, attacking each missile individually by point defense fire is quite impractical. To simplify such combat, use the following rule. At the beginning of each round, the defender decides how many, if any, energy weapons are dedicated to point defense. This applies a negative DM to all incoming missiles' hit throws, per the following table. Sand Canisters also apply a DM-1 similar to laser point defense.

Streamlined Point Defense – for ships up to 999 tons
Weapons	DM to incoming missiles
1	-1
2-4	-2
5-7	-3
8-9	-4

Optional Rule: Streamlined Point Defense for ships of 1000+ tons
To resolve streamlined point defense for ships of 1000-10000 tons, use the following table of laser turrets and sand canisters vs. missiles. The attacker makes a single attack throw, Gunnery/INT 8+, without modifiers; if successful, at least some of the missiles hit their target. Then consult the following table to find how many hits were caused by the missiles that penetrated the target’s defensive laser fire. Results marked with a dash (“- “) means that no hits are possible even with a successful attack throw. The left-most vertical column in the number of laser turrets; the top horizonal row is the number of inbound missiles.
The table assumed unarmored, 1000+ tons, starships, which are always rated at Light Armor. For ships rated at Heavy Armor (i.e., Lightly Armored large ships), consider the number of lasers being two steps better; nuclear weapons ignore this. Non-nuclear missiles are ineffective vs. Heavy Armor and nuclear missiles suffer from the number of lasers being two steps better. Both conventional and nuclear missiles are ineffective against Massive Armor.

Missile vs Laser Turret hits
No. of laser turrets/sand/No. of missiles	10-20	21-30	31-40	41-50	51-60	61-80	81+
10-20	1D	2D	3D	1 Critical	1D Critical	Destroyed!	Destroyed!
21-30	1D	2D	2D	3D	1 Critical	Destroyed!	Destroyed!
31-40	1	1D	1D	2D	3D	1 Critical	1D Critical
41-50	-	1	1	1D	2D	3D	1 Critical
51-60	-	-	1	1	1D	2D	3D
61-80	-	-	-	1	1	1D	2D
81+	-	-	-	-	1	1	1D

Engineer Actions
Any character with the Engineering skill can perform Damage Control – emergency repairs of damaged systems and breaches. Multiple characters with this skill may perform damage control at the same time, each on a different system. Throw Engineering/INT 8+ to repair a damaged system or to jury-rig a single disabled system back into operation. Success temporarily repairs one hit on the system. The damage will reappear in 1D hours. Note: destroyed systems cannot be repaired or jury-rigged during combat.
Characters without the Engineering skill but with the Repair skill may assist an engineer in damage control, using the Aid Other rules in the Basic Game Mechanics chapter.
Repair drones can make one damage control check per combat round.
Overcharge Weapon: the engineer can disable the safeties on an energy weapon for extra damage. Throw Engineering/EDU 8+ to boost a single energy turret’s Hits rating by +1, including all energy weapons mounted on said turret.
Redline Engines: the ship’s chief engineer throws Engineering/EDU 8+. On a success, the ship’s thrust rating increases by 1 for next round (including the Position throw).
Starship Damage
When an attack hits a target, refer to the Ship Penetration Matrix Table below, then roll on the appropriate component damage table. Each weapon indicates (in its “hit” statistic) how many rolls to make on that table. Roll radiation damage separately on the Radiation Table. If a Gunner scores a particularly stunning hit with Effect 6+, shift one column to the left when reading damage. That is, if a gunner fired a beam laser and hit a target with Light Armor, it would normally do Surface damage. However, if that gunner rolled an Effect 6+, treat the target as Unarmored; the attack would do Internal damage.
Ship Penetration Matrix Table

Surface and Internal Hit Descriptions
The following is a description of ship system internal hits. Note that if a system is destroyed, any more damage on the same system has no further effect.
Breach
The ship suffers a hull breach and is exposed to vacuum. Anyone not wearing a space Suit or in a sealed compartment suffers exposure to vacuum per the Adventuring chapter. Staterooms are considered sealed for the purposes of this damage. On large ships of above 1000 tons, each Breach depressurizes 1000 tons of the ship.
Bridge
The bridge is hit.
First Hit: the crew suffers a Crew Hit (see below). DM-2 on all future Position rolls.
Second Hit: bridge disabled; Captain, Pilot, and Sensor Operator actions are impossible until the bridge is repaired, and Gunnery throws suffer DM-2. The crew suffers a Crew Hit (see below).
Third Hit: bridge irreparably destroyed; each bridge crew member suffers 4D damage, reduced by personal armor.
Cockpit
The small craft’s cockpit is hit.
First Hit: the crew suffers a Crew Hit (see below). DM-2 on all future Position rolls.
Second Hit: cockpit disabled; all actions are impossible; The crew suffers a Crew Hit (see below).
Third Hit: cockpit irreparably destroyed, and each bridge crew member suffers 4D damage.
Crew
1D crew members and passengers suffer 2D damage each. If there are fewer people than the number rolled, one or more of them, randomly determined, will receive multiple hits. Personal armor reduces this damage.
Critical Crew Hit
All crew and passengers suffer 4D damage each. This damage can be reduced by personal armor.
Electronics
The electronic systems are hit.
First Hit: The electronics are scrambled. Until the system is repaired, the ship suffers a DM-2 to all Computer, Piloting, and Gunnery rolls.
Second Hit: The electronics are disabled. The ship cannot make any Piloting or Computer rolls and cannot maneuver; it loses any benefits from software until the electronics repaired. Manual gunnery is still possible at a DM-4.
Third Hit: The ship’s electronic systems are completely burned out.
Subsequent Hits: No effect.
Fuel
The jump fuel tank is hit.
First Hit: 1Dx5% of fuel tank capacity is destroyed.
Second Hit: 1Dx10% of the fuel tank capacity is destroyed. This fuel loss is in addition to the losses of the first hit.
Third Hit: Fuel tanks destroyed; all jump fuel is lost
Hold
The cargo hold is hit.
First Hit: 1Dx5% of the cargo is destroyed.
Second Hit: 1Dx10% of cargo is destroyed. This cargo loss is in addition to the losses of the first hit.
Third Hit: the cargo hold, and all its contents are destroyed.
J-Drive
The ship’s jump drive is hit.
First Hit: DM-2 to any attempt to jump.
Second Hit: jump drive disabled.
Third Hit: jump drive irreparably destroyed.
M-Drive
The maneuver drive is hit.
First Hit: halve the ship’s remaining thrust (round down).
Second Hit: maneuver drive disabled. The ship is adrift and has a Position of 0.
Third Hit: maneuver drive irreparably destroyed.
Power Plant
The power plant is hit.
First Hit: halve the ship’s thrust and jump rating (round down).
Second Hit: power plant disabled. The ship is functioning on emergency power. Energy weapons fire is impossible. The ship can maneuver, but will always lose Position.
Third Hit: power plant irreparably destroyed. Emergency power remains for 1D hours; afterwards, life support systems will fail. Low berths are unaffected by this as they have an integral, long-term power supply.
Sensors
The ship’s antennae and other sensor equipment are hit.
First Hit: ship sensor DM reduced by -1 (cumulative with electronics damage) Ship can no longer obtain Sensor Locks
Second Hit: ship sensor DM reduced by -2. Ship cannot make or break Sensor Locks and gunners suffer DM-2 to missile lock attempts.
Third Hit: Sensors disabled. Gunnery missile lock attempts suffer DM-6.
Weapons
Each hit disables one weapon in a given location:
2D	Location
2-9	Turret hit
10-11	Bay hit
12	Main gun hit
If there are no bays or main guns, disable turret weapons instead.
Multiple hits on the same weapon (not just turret) destroy the weapon. Additional hits on a destroyed weapon are transferred to other randomly determined weapon systems

Repairing Damage
Jury-rigged systems repaired using the Damage Control action will fail within 1D hours. After that, the system requires full repairs. Throw Engineering/EDU 8+ to fully repair a damaged system; this takes 1D hours and requires 0.02 tons of spare parts per ton of repaired system. A successful throw returns the system to operational status. A failed throw may be repeated but will require additional spare parts.
Spare parts cost Cr100,000 per ton, and may be stored in the ship's cargo bay.
Multiple engineers may work on repairs simultaneously, provided that each works on a different system. Alternately, multiple engineers may work on the same repair using the Aid Another rules.
Replacing a destroyed system requires a shipyard and costs 2Dx10% of the system’s original cost.
